01b0d8ea3c0d1f16a6eb6564ea04dd48,"LOS ANGELES () — Prosecutors will recommend Erik and Lyle Menendez be resentenced for the 1989 killings of their parents in the family’s Beverly Hills home, providing the brothers with a chance at freedom after 34 years behind bars.Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced during a Thursday news conference that his office would recommend the brothers be sentenced to 50 years to life. Because they were under 26 years old at the time of the crimes, they will be eligible for parole immediately, he said. “I came to a place where I believe, under the law, resentencing is propriate,” Gascón said. He said some members of his office oppose the decision.Prosecutors will file the petition on Friday and a hearing before a judge could come within the next month or so.The Menendez brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Lyle Menendez, then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they fatally shot their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez. The brothers said they feared their parents were about to kill them to stop people from finding out that Jose Menendez had sexually abused Erik Menendez for years. Family largely united in asking for brothers’ freedomThe brothers’ extended family has pleaded for their release, saying they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today’s world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.Multiple members of their extended family, including their aunt Joan Andersen VanderMolen, sat in the first few rows of Thursday’s news conference. VanderMolen was Kitty Menendez’s sister and has publicly supported their release. Mark Geragos, an attorney for the brothers, was also there.Anamaria Baralt, a niece of Jose Menendez, said the district attorney’s “brave and necessary” decision means “Lyle and Erik can finally begin to heal from the trauma of their past.” The Menendez brothers were tried twice for their parents’ murders, with the first trial ending in a hung jury.Prosecutors at the time contended that there was no evidence of molestation, and many details in their story of sexual abuse were not permitted in the second trial. The district attorney’s office also said back then that the brothers were after their parents’ multimillion-dollar estate.District attorney believes Erik and Lyle ‘paid their debt’Gascón said he made the final decision only an hour before the news conference and that family members were told just minutes before.Despite their life sentences, Gascón said the brothers worked on redemption and rehabilitation inside prison.“I believe that they have paid their debt to society,” he said.Not all Menendez family members support resentencing. Attorneys for Milton Andersen, the 90-year-old brother of Kitty Menendez, filed a legal brief asking the court to keep the brothers’ original punishment. “They shot their mother, Kitty, reloading to ensure her death,” Andersen’s attorneys said in a statement Thursday. “The evidence remains overwhelmingly clear: the jury’s verdict was just, and the punishment fits the heinous crime.” Though Kitty Menendez was not accused of abusing her sons, she pears to have facilitated the abuse, according to her sons’ legal filings. One cousin testified during the brothers’ first trial that Lyle told her he was too scared to sleep in his room because his father would come in and touch his genitals. When the cousin told Kitty Menendez, she “angrily dragged Lyle upstairs by his arm,” the petition said.Another family member testified that when Jose Menendez was in the bedroom with one of the boys, no one was allowed to walk down the hallway outside. Could an election turn the tide again?The LA district attorney is in the middle of a tough reelection fight against former federal prosecutor Nathan Hochman who has blamed Gascón’s progressive reform policies for recent high-profile murders and increased retail crime.Gascón said Thursday that his office has recommended resentencing for some 300 offenders, including people behind bars for murder.Hochman on Thursday questioned the timing of the Gascón’s announcement, coming less than two weeks before the election and calling it a “desperate political move.” He said he is unable to form his own opinion on the case without access to confidential records and relevant witnesses.“If I become DA and the case is still pending at that time, I will conduct a review consistent with how I would review any case,” Hochman said.The Menendez case has gained new traction in recent weeks after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama “ Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.”The evidence under prosecutorial review included a letter written by Erik Menendez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he was sexually abused by his father. Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, also recently came forward saying he was drugged and red by Jose Menendez, the boys’ father, when he was a teen in the 1980s.Menudo was signed under RCA Records, which Jose Menendez headed at the time.Rossello spoke about his abuse in the 2023 Peacock docuseries “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.” His allegations are part of the evidence listed in the petition filed last year by the Menendez brothers’ attorney, seeking a review of their case. Rossello’s assertion that he was red twice by Jose Menendez is part of the Menendez brothers’ petition. ___ This story corrects the spelling of Milton Andersen’s name.

046b8819d2e6f5f8821c6fc59e790bc4,"WASHINGTON () — As a presidential race profoundly shed by Americans’ frustration with high prices nears its end, the government said Thursday that an inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve has dropped to near pre-pandemic levels.The Commerce Department reported that prices rose just 2.1% in September from a year earlier, down from a 2.3% rise in August. That is barely above the Fed’s 2% inflation target and in line with readings in 2018, well before prices began surging after the pandemic recession.Yet some signs of inflation pressures remained. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose 2.7% in September from a year earlier for the third straight month. On a monthly basis, core prices rose 0.3% from August to September, up from 0.2% from July to August. The increase in the core rate is higher than the Fed would prefer. Still, for the past six months, core inflation has declined to a 2.3% annual rate, down from 2.5% in August. And economists still expect the Fed to cut its key rate by a quarter-point when it meets next week.“It’s essentially the soft landing that many of us dreamed of,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and accounting firm EY, referring to a scenario in which high interest rates manage to tame inflation without causing a recession. “You really have the best of both worlds, with consumer spending growth remaining resilient and inflation moving within striking distance of the Fed’s 2% target.” A separate measure of worker pay that the government issued Thursday — the employment cost index — showed that wages and benefits grew just 0.8% in the July-September quarter, the slowest such pace in three years. Measured from the same quarter a year earlier, workers’ paychecks, excluding government employees, rose 3.8%, a pace consistent with the Fed’s inflation target, Daco said. Though faster wage growth provides a boost for workers, it can also fuel inflation if companies pass on their higher labor costs to consumers by raising prices. Taken as a whole, the latest signs of a sustained cooling of inflation arrive five days before an election in which many voters have soured on the economy, mostly because average prices remain nearly 20% higher than they were four years ago. Former President Donald Trump has largely blamed the Biden-Harris administration’s energy policies and promised that inflation would “ vanish completely ” if he is elected. Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to ban price gouging for groceries and to reduce child care and health care costs. Economists say Trump’s policies would actually worsen inflation, mainly because of his plans to impose sweeping new tariffs and embark on mass deportations of migrants and other immigrants. Harris’ proposals on price gouging, experts have said, would have little short-term impact.Thursday’s report also showed that Americans remain confident enough in their finances to keep shopping: Spending jumped 0.5% from August to September, which helped the economy expand at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter. Incomes rose more slowly last month, the government said, rising just 0.3%. In response, Americans cut back on their savings, leaving the savings rate at 4.6%, down from 4.8% the previous month. On a monthly basis, prices inched up 0.2% from August to September, up slightly from a 0.1% increase from July to August. Inflation peaked at 7.1% in June 2022 after the economy had accelerated out of the pandemic recession at a time of severe shortages of parts and labor, according to the gauge released Thursday, called the personal consumption expenditures price index. Inflation has steadily cooled over the past two years after supply chains recovered from the pandemic disruptions and the Fed jacked up its key interest rate to a four-decade high, depressing home sales and auto purchases. The Fed tends to favor the inflation gauge that the government issued Thursday — the personal consumption expenditures price index — over the better-known consumer price index. The PCE index tries to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. It can cture, for example, when consumers switch from pricier national brands to cheer store brands. In general, the PCE index tends to show a lower inflation rate than CPI. In part, that’s because rents, which have been high, carry double the weight in the CPI that they do in the index released Friday.Chair Jerome Powell signaled in late August that the Fed is increasingly confident that inflation is coming under control. And hiring weakened in July and August. Those trends led the Fed to cut its key rate by an outsize half-point last month. With inflation continuing to slow, the Fed is expected to further reduce its rate by a quarter-point in November and likely by another quarter-point in December. The outlook for future rate cuts isn’t quite clear, though. Hiring rebounded sharply in September, and the unemployment rate fell to a low 4.1%, evidence that the job market may be stronger than it had peared last summer. Retail sales also rose last month. And on Wednesday, the government estimated that the economy expanded at a 2.8% annual rate in the July-September quarter, a solid pace, fueled by strong consumer spending.The upbeat economic data has sparked some speculation that the Fed might decide to skip a rate reduction in December or cut rates more slowly next year.On Friday, the government will issue its last major economic data before the presidential election: the October jobs report. It is likely to provide a more muddled picture than usual of the labor market, because Hurricanes Helene and Milton are thought to have caused tens of thousands of workers to lose their jobs, at least temporarily.",https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-e4ff4b6745ea1c8badd6a0502f372f25,apnews,Agree,Agree,3,-1,3.0,-1.0,Agree,Agree,"The article presents a balanced view of the economic situation, highlighting both the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to control inflation and the criticisms from former President Trump.

06a99d616ad7ab7f9720f2cf4dee28eb,"Football teams I root for have a maddening habit of following up a big play with a sack, a tackle for a loss, or some setback that erases the gain and leaves things no better than before. Those of us who have been dejected by the nation’s long slide into cultural bullying and censorship have seen some highly encouraging gains lately, but experience has taught us to keep our hopes under control. Team Freedom has had a long losing streak, and it will take more than a few first downs to prove that free expression and inquiry are truly back in the game.Certainly, the score looks closer in both of the principal arenas of combat. In academe, the shocking losses of the past school year forced a number of coaching changes and new policies that, if stood by and enforced, will make for freer campus environments.Dozens of schools, including the University of Southern California and Columbia University, have discovered the propriety, and the safety, of institutional neutrality on matters unrelated to their enterprises and missions. Many have belatedly deciphered the simple distinction between speech and conduct. Schools including the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University have banned the encampments and blockades of buildings about which they “negotiated” a few months back.In the corporate world, the shift seems even more pronounced. Chief executives have ceased genuflecting to the idols of “diversity, equity and inclusion,” closing DEI departments and omitting mentions of the topic and its cousin, “environmental, social and governance” (ESG), from investor calls and annual reports.External pressures have propelled both trends. Watching the likes of Target, Disney and Budweiser take sales hits, corporate execs concluded that “virtue”-signaling on political issues they knew nothing about might not be cost-free after all.Follow Opinions on the newsMany state legislatures have threatened budget cuts or even ordered the closure of DEI programs, as well as an end to the loyalty oaths with which faculties have ensured ideological purity and the exclusion of unwelcome moderate or conservative additions from their ranks. Think of these as defensive holding calls by the referees, first downs due to penalties.More than a few college presidents will protest but silently welcome such mandates, which enable them to shrink or close frequent sources of division and discord on their campuses, saving needed dollars as they do.The intellectual front has also brightened. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences devoted its entire summer 2024 journal, Daedalus, to a lively colloquium on “the future of free speech.” No one attempted to make a case for the censorship regimes that have been so dominant in our era.Among the broader public, free expression is selling books. Scholars such as Yale University political scientist Keith E. Whittington, author of the recent book “You Can’t Teach That!,” have challenged campus groupthink in the most damning and effective way, by pointing out that enforced conformity of thought strikes at the heart of the academic enterprise: the advance of knowledge through, and only through, the collision and constant comparison of alternative views.Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott’s bestseller last year, “The Canceling of the American Mind,” inundated its readers with examples of the abuses, and the viciousness, with which the mini-tyrants in our institutions have been stifling the views they deem unacceptable, while trying to compel obeisance to their own brand of orthodoxy.Yet every promising gain seems to be followed by a negative yardage play. Penn, the same school that announced changes to its policies regarding campus disruption and encampment, turned around last month and suspended a faculty member, law professor Amy Wax, explicitly because of her viewpoints. Cornell University last month allowed about 100 students to shut down a job fair — some companies involved in national defense work were present — thereby directly interfering with their schoolmates’ career aspirations. The school announced penalties, but we’ll see. Similar announcements of disciplinary action by Columbia and other colleges were quietly shelved a few months after being issued.There is zero doubt that many of the parent improvements are illusory or meant to be temporary. The DEI label and loyalty oaths might go away, but the same practices and pressures will often remain. Referees, preferably trustees and corporate directors rather than politicians, will need to be vigilant.The contest will ultimately be decided by the 12th Man — the public in the bleachers. An analysis in the Economist last month declared that we have passed “peak woke,” and that opinion is moving against the censors and silencers. The data shifts, even if indicative, aren’t big enough to persuade.For now, a freedom fan can at most celebrate a few gains after years of defeat and retreat, and honor those who have braved the cancelers to create those gains. Later this year, the Russell Kirk Center in Michigan will bestow its first McLellan Prize for courage and impact in defending free expression. (I served as a juror.) The recipient, Greg Lukianoff, in addition to his books and other advocacy, has for years led the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, the nation’s leading watchdog group in this subject area.Every team should recognize its MVP. But great individual play is no guarantee of victory. Paul Hornung won a Heisman Trophy on a 2-8 team. I can’t see a scoreboard from where I’m sitting, but I strongly suspect that it says Team Freedom is still in catch-up mode.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/09/college-campus-free-speech-protest-policies,washingtonpost,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,2,4,-2.0,4.0,Agree,Disagree,"The article leans towards supporting the Republican party as it criticizes cultural bullying, censorship, and the influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which are often associated with Democratic policies.

070a072d66f8d0e7994bb92a6c38758d,"NEW YORK — The United States, France and several Arab nations were among the countries that on Wednesday jointly called for a 21-day cease-fire deal to avert a wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.The diplomatic push for a temporary halt in fighting comes as Israel’s military chief told soldiers to prepare for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon. Biden administration officials, briefing reporters under ground rules of anonymity, said they expected that the Israeli and Lebanese governments would accept the deal “in the coming hours.”The cease-fire deal is the product of days of frantic diplomacy at the United Nations, with many key leaders gathered in New York for the annual general assembly, which has coincided with Israel’s intensified campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Hundreds have been killed, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, as Israel unleashed a wave of airstrikes and turned electronic devices into bombs.The Biden administration and the French government emerged as key leaders of the effort, but Group of 7 nations, Australia, the European Union as well as the Arab nations of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have been coordinating and trying to massage both sides to achieve an agreement.In a separate joint statement Wednesday, President Joe Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France called for broad endorsement of a deal to “give diplomacy a chance.”“It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,” they said. “The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians.”Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Biden said the United States was able to generate “significant support from Europe as well as the Arab nations” for the proposed cease-fire deal. “It’s important the war does not widen,” he added.“War is not inevitable,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the 15-member United Nations Security Council on Wednesday. “A diplomatic solution is indeed possible.”Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati told the council: “France stood by our side in the darkest circumstances, the best proof being the efforts France is making today in collaboration with the United States in order to issue a joint communiqué that enjoys international support and which would put an end to this dirty war.”The signatories of the agreement would not directly include Hezbollah, raising the possibility that it could be shaky, and the U.S. officials did not immediately explain why they were optimistic about the militant and political group’s involvement. But they said that they expected that if the Lebanese government agrees to the deal, it will be able to bring along the group. The United States does not speak directly to Hezbollah, which it has designated a terrorist organization.The goal during the cease-fire is to reach a comprehensive agreement “that allows for residents to return to their homes in both Lebanon and Israel,” a senior administration official said.“It’s been an all-out effort by the administration to reach this moment,” the official said, expressing gratitude “to both the Israelis and the Lebanese government.”The White House has tasked adviser Amos Hochstein to be the main negotiator on the Israel-Lebanon situation, and he has spent much of his time in the region over the past year on resolving the fighting with Hezbollah.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also taken a leading role in shuttling among European and Arab diplomats to try to build support for the deal, and got his Qatari and Saudi counterparts to sign on to it on Wednesday. Blinken and Hochstein also met Lebanese Prime Minister Mikati to sound him out about the proposal, a U.S. official familiar with the situation said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive closed-door meetings.Hezbollah has consistently said it would stop firing rockets into Israel once Israel ended its military campaign in Gaza. The U.S. call for a short-term cease-fire in Lebanon is the latest indication that Washington does not see a Gaza hostage-release cease-fire deal hpening imminently and is embracing Israel’s preference to prioritize a cease-fire in Lebanon first.The Biden administration has said it is focused on unlinking the first phase of a cease-fire in Lebanon from a deal between Israel and Hamas, which remains deadlocked. But senior officials on Wednesday evening said they hoped discussions over a longer-term agreement in Lebanon could also renew negotiations in Gaza.Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has sought a broader conflict, one U.S. official said, and depriving him of that possibility may eventually lead him to be more willing to accept a deal that would sw hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military matter, told reporters Wednesday that Israel is open to a “diplomatic solution” with Hezbollah that allows Israeli forces to continue their military campaign in Gaza.“Israel has increased military pressure on Hezbollah to delink the two fronts,” said the official, referring to the simultaneous military campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. “Israel is not seeking war but is also not deterred by it.”The official added that “Hezbollah has given [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar control over Lebanese civilians by linking the fronts.”The Israeli government is hoping that its bombardment of Lebanon, which has dealt a significant blow to Hezbollah’s command and control cabilities and Radwan forces, will convince the group to agree to a cease-fire. But whether Hezbollah can back down and maintain its credibility after Israel’s brazen pager and walkie-talkie attacks, as well as extensive airstrikes, remains to be seen.Israeli residents who have fled Hezbollah rockets in the northern part of the country are unlikely to return to their homes until there are clearer guarantees that they can remain there safely, leading to the need for a full agreement, a U.S. official said.“It was always going to have to be more than just a cease-fire, because it would be unacceptable for Israeli residents to return to their homes in the north if there weren’t security arrangements on the Lebanese side that prevented Hezbollah from sitting on the border and ensuring that they were secure from an October 7th-like attack in the future,” the official said.Barrot, the French foreign minister, said he is heading to Beirut this week to continue to work on the proposed deal.“We are counting on both parties to accept it without delay, in order to protect civilian populations and allow for diplomatic negotiations to begin,” he told the U.N. gathering.In an address earlier Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres urged both sides to “step back from the brink” and avoid a war that would “surely be an all-out catastrophe.”Pannett reported from Wellington, New Zealand.

The turbulence has rattled both major parties and left many voters unsettled and prehensive.” The Review-Journal went on to summarize the chaos of the last few months, including both failed assassination attempts on Trump, his guilty verdict for 34 felonies in New York, his debate against President Joe Biden that became the catalyst for Biden’s exit from the race, and Harris subsequently becoming the Democrat nominee. “Thus began one of the more cynical and ambitious rehabilitation efforts in the history of modern politics. A vid, unpopular vice president in an unpopular administration who flamed out spectacularly in her 2020 run for the Oval Office was within weeks recast as a purveyor of ‘joy’ and an amalgamation of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Mahatma Gandhi,” the publication continued. Contrasting her past and current opinions, the Nevada outlet wrote that Harris is being portrayed as a “tough-on-crime border hawk” after her history as a “San Francisco leftist who sympathized with the defund-police movement.” She has also backtracked on her prior views on key issues such as energy, health care, and the Senate filibuster. “To advance the swindle, Ms. Harris carefully avoids any unscripted interviews unless a friendly questioner tosses the softballs slowly enough for her to make contact,” the outlet continued, before saying that its newsroom is “under no illusions about Donald Trump.” “His behavior in response to the Jan. 6 mayhem was dispointing and indefensible — although the constitutional guardrails held firm,” the newsper wrote. “His penchant for dwelling on past grievances isn’t helpful. His insistence that every election he loses is ‘rigged’ is petulant and fatuous.” “But Mr. Trump has a four-year record as president for undecided voters to consider.” Arguing that “Earth didn’t stop spinning while he occupied the Oval Office,” the Review-Journal went on to note that Trump’s term was “marked by relative global stability and a strong American economy.” According to the writers, inflation “was an afterthought” and judges who “respect the Constitution’s limits on government power” were pointed during the Republican’s presidency. They also mentioned the “tightened” security at the southern border and the “rid development of vaccines” during the coronavirus pandemic. The outlet then compared those four years from 2017 to 2021 to the time since Biden-Harris took office, with the national debt hitting $35 trillion and inflation hitting nine percent. “Housing costs have soared, including in Las Vegas,” the publication stated. “High interest rates make it more difficult for new homebuyers and burden families carrying credit card and other debt. If this weren’t destructive enough, Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden turned a blind eye to the border for three years, releasing millions of illegal crossers into the country and causing mayors in blue cities to cry uncle.” “Yet Ms. Harris assures Americans she wouldn’t have changed a thing,” the writers said. The Review-Journal was purchased in 2015 by News + Media Cital Group LLC, which was later revealed to be owned by the late billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2020. Adelson, a gambling industry tycoon who amassed an empire of casinos in Las Vegas, Singore, and Macao, China, became Trump’s largest donor in his first reelection effort, according to Bloomberg. The outlet is still owned by the billionaire’s widow, Miriam Adelson. “Many voters are dissatisfied with the choice before them in November. They have a point,” the Review-Journal said, before concluding the article. “But when we weigh the policy results of Mr. Trump’s four years in office against those of Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden, the contrast becomes difficult to ignore. Donald Trump is the better choice.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/14/las-vegas-review-journal-endorses-donald-trump-president,breitbart,Agree,Agree,1,4,0.0,4.0,Agree,Disagree,"The article supports the Republican party by endorsing Donald Trump for the upcoming election, highlighting his past achievements such as economic stability and border security during his presidency.

0cd4abe05c98af0dd1f64574c1a67729,"LAS VEGAS () — Minutes after Donald Trump delivered his standard warnings about drug dealers and criminals illegally crossing the border during a Saturday campaign event, the former president heard from someone who was once in the country illegally but now plans to vote for him.Elias Trujillo was one of several people who spoke Saturday at a Latino roundtable in Las Vegas intended to spotlight Trump’s economic ideas. After Trump finished addressing a small crowd inside the warehouse of a women’s cosmetics company, members of the roundtable spoke. Trujillo began by telling his personal story, how his mother brought him and his brothers from northern Mexico to Utah in 1995 to rejoin their father, who was working in construction.“We came here legally, but you know, we overstayed, and we were able to make life here in the United States,” Trujillo said, referring to the action of entering the U.S. on a legal visa but not departing when that visa expires.At least one person in the audience began laughing and plauding, leading Trujillo to laugh and acknowledge, “It is funny.” Trump smiled as he looked at Trujillo.The moment highlighted the contradictory ways the facts and rhetoric of immigration play in the campaign. The paradoxes are sharper as Trump has simultaneously counted on increased support from Latinos returning him to the White House even as he has centered his campaign on a dark view of immigration.Trump has said migrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country, called the recent influx across the southern border an “invasion” and pledged to launch mass deportations if he returns to the White House.The day before his Las Vegas roundtable, Trump was in Aurora, Colorado, darkly warning that a Venezuelan gang is terrorizing a city of 400,000 that has become a magnet for migrants from that country. The city’s Republican mayor said Trump is distorting an isolated problem in the city.On Saturday, Trump launched his usual criticisms of border policy before pivoting to general praises of the demogrhic he was courting.“Hispanic people — they say you can’t generalize, but I think you can — they have wonderful entrepreneurship and they have — oh, do you have such energy. Just ease up a little bit, OK? Ease up,” Trump said. “You have great ambition, you have great energy, very smart, and you really do, like natural entrepreneurs.”Trump has usually smoothed over any parent conflict between his warnings on immigration and his support from Latino voters since 2016, when he kicked off his first run by warning of “rists” crossing the southern border. Many Hispanic voters entered the country legally — or have roots in the U.S. going back generations — and oppose illegal immigration.The former president and Republican nominee has argued his economic and immigration policies would help Latinos and other minorities, often suggesting contrary to economic data that immigrants are taking what he calls “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs.” Around 8 in 10 Hispanic voters say the economy is “one of the most important issues” during this election season, according to a recent-NORC Center for Public Opinion Research poll.Overall, Hispanic voters are about equally likely to say they have a favorable view of Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent. Trujillo said during his speech that he was initially wary of Trump but has grown to support the former president.Elias Trujillo, left, listens with others at a campaign event for republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, center, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024, in North Las Vegas. ( Photo/Lucas Peltier)viaTrujillo described how his lack of legal status made him feel uncertain about what he could accomplish, but how he “had to make the best of my life.” He said he graduated from high school, got married and had two children, now 12 and 5.He opened a restaurant that he said is struggling due to the high cost of labor and goods, and said he was hopeful Trump would usher in better economic times.“I’m hpy with the opportunity that Trump has again to run and hopefully get us back on track,” Trujillo said. “I think there’s room to make America greater.”Afterward, Trujillo said in an interview that though his parents overstayed their visas, they achieved legal status. Likewise, Trujillo has been a U.S. citizen since 2011.He said he has come to understand Trump’s vocal opposition to those entering the country illegally due to concerns about drug and sex trafficking.But, unprompted, Trujillo said he supports a way for people in the country illegally to obtain legal status, specifically people who have been working and following the law.Support Free JournalismConsider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.Can't afford to contribute? by creating a free account and log in while you read.?The stakes are high this year, and our 2024 coverage could use continued support.

Trump’s rehearsed defiance make his supporters feel as though there’s nothing he won’t share.Former President Donald J. Trump at a campaign rally near Green Bay, Wis., on Wednesday....Doug Mills/Oct. 31, 2024, ETAt a rally this week in Wisconsin, Donald Trump launched into an imitation of his own staff, pleading with him to behave differently. The performance was a classic of the genre.It came during a riff about how he wants to “protect the women,” a formulation his advisers parently do not preciate. “‘Sir, please don’t say that,’” he said in the tone of voice a child uses to imitate an adult. “They said, ‘We think it’s very inpropriate for you to say.’ I said, ‘Why, I’m president? I want to protect the women of our country.’ They said, ‘Sir, I just think it’s inpropriate for you to say.’”He added, “I pay these guys a lot of money. Can you believe it?” But then he told the audience not to worry, for he had stood up to the grown-ups on his payroll. “I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it. Whether the women like it or not, I’m going to protect them.’”Since the beginning of Mr. Trump’s political rise, this sort of flourish has been a feature of his political oratory. He builds up to something he is parently not supposed to say, delighting his crowds when he says it anyway. His own staff often functions as the straw man in these scenarios, the overly cautious and overpaid stiffs he is defying in order to keep it real at all times.Mr. Trump did become president by ignoring the advice of political hacks and doing whatever his gut told him to. But nearly a decade later, what he presents as acts of untamed spontaneity are often actually quite deliberate. It’s all part of the routine by now. And yet, this ability to convey that he is doing or saying something daring or novel even when he is not remains part of his peal with some voters.The Wisconsin rally wasn’t even the first time he acted out that particular bit. Two nights earlier, he was in Atlanta, pretending to go off the same script: “I think it’s fine to say I will protect the women of this country,” he said. “They said, ‘Please, sir. Please don’t say that.’”Keep Up With the 2024 ElectionThe presidential election is 5 days away. Here’s our guide to the run-up to Election Day.On Politics Newsletter.

The women won’t like it.’” On Thursday, in New Mexico, he called Ms. Harris “dumb as a rock” and said “I shouldn’t say this about an opponent, but I have to.”He has done impressions of his staff begging him not to insult people’s looks, before insulting their looks. He regularly performs an imitation of the pastor Franklin Graham advising him not to use foul language, before using foul language. During the Republican primaries, he bragged, parently against the wishes of his staff, about how beloved he was in Iowa, while he was in Iowa: “My guys say, ‘Please, sir, don’t take it for granted that you’re going to win Iowa. It doesn’t sound good.’”Rehearsed transgressions. They serve all kinds of purposes. His adversaries and the news media often taken the bait he lays out for them, reliably erupting in outrage right on cue. Which only amplifies the pleasure his audiences get out of such remarks. The “I’m not supposed to say this” shtick also reinforces the bond between Mr. Trump and his audience by making them feel as though there’s nothing he won’t share with them about the wild ride they’re on together.He told the people of New Mexico that his very presence before them on Thursday afternoon was itself an act of defiance. He said people told him not to come, that he couldn’t win there. And yet, there he was.Lately, he has been firing up his crowds with a new bit of practiced rebellion. He says he’s not supposed to boast about early voting numbers, but then says it’s looking really good. “I’m not supposed to say this,” he said in Michigan the other day before saying “we're sort of way up.” (The data suggests a race that is historically close; Mr. Trump has already begun to foment doubts that the results can be trusted.)Two days earlier, he was onstage in Las Vegas. “Look, I’m not supposed to say it,” he said, “but we are leading by so much.”Michael Gold contributed reporting.SKIP ADVERTISEMENT",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/elections/trump-blaming-staff.html,nytimes,Somewhat Disagree,Disagree,-2,-3,0.0,0.0,Disagree,Disagree,"The article appears to have a critical tone towards Donald Trump, highlighting his rehearsed defiance and tendency to ignore advice from his staff.

217cdceb4f35039978dde94cb28712ca,"BEIRUT () — Two back-to-back strikes in Beirut and Tehran, both attributed to Israel and targeting high-ranking figures in Hamas and Hezbollah, have left Hezbollah and Iran in a quandary.Analysts agree that both strikes hit too close to home to pass without a response, and were serious security breaches for Iran and Hezbollah. Calibrating that response to restore deterrence without sparking an even more damaging escalation may be the most delicate balancing act in nearly a year of teetering on the brink of a regional war.Tuesday’s rare strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs killed a top Hezbollah commander who Israel says was responsible for a missile strike on a soccer field in the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack.While the target of the strike in Beirut was a military figure, it hit a densely populated urban neighborhood on the outskirts of the cital where Hezbollah has many of its offices, killing at least five civilians — three women and two children — and wounding dozens more. Less than 12 hours later, the Palestinian militant group Hamas — a Hezbollah ally also backed by Iran — announced that the chief of its political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Tehran, where he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president. Israel has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for that strike, which comes nearly 10 months into the brutal war in Gaza sparked by Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. It also coincides with another push by mediators to close a cease-fire and hostage-exchange deal. Haniyeh’s assassination left Iran’s new president, the reformist politician and heart surgeon Masoud Pezeshkian, facing a major crisis within hours of taking office. The decision on how to retaliate will fall to Iran’s national security council, of which the president is the chief, although in practice the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the final say. Analysts said both Hezbollah and Iran will feel compelled to retaliate, but their calculations differ.Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center who researches Hezbollah, said that although Israel also struck in Beirut’s southern suburbs in a January attack that killed Hamas official Saleh Arouri, Tuesday’s strike targeted a top Hezbollah commander and killed civilians.“This time, we’re too far into the war, and a Hezbollah commander is the target. Hezbollah has to respond, and if they don’t, this would be a new rule: Killing civilians on the Israeli side would lead to targeting of” the Beirut suburbs, he said. “Hezbollah cannot afford this.”Hezbollah began firing rockets over the Lebanon-Israel border the day after the war in Gaza began, in what it described as a “support front” for Hamas. Although the near-daily clashes have been deadly and have displaced tens of thousands in both Lebanon and Israel, they have remained mostly confined to the border region. In order to reestablish deterrence after Tuesday’s strike, Ali said, “Hezbollah would need to respond beyond its now-limited geogrhical scope of operations. They need to strike deeper in Israeli territories, and this brings with it great risks.”Andreas Krieg, a military analyst and senior lecturer in security studies at King’s College London, agreed that Hezbollah will feel the need to carry out a significant retaliatory strike.“I think Hezbollah has been hit much harder, much more where it hurts” than Iran, he said. “In the Israeli-Hezbollah confrontation, this is a major escalation whereby Hezbollah has to respond adequately in a more or less timely fashion” to restore deterrence.However, the militant group will probably hit a significant military target — such as an air force base near Haifa that peared in a video of surveillance drone footage the group released in July — rather than a civilian target, he said, and will most likely try to calibrate the attack to cause only material damage to limit further escalation. Nabih Awada, a Lebanese political and military analyst close to the Iranian-backed “axis of resistance” and a former fighter with the Lebanese Communist Party who spent a decade in Israeli prisons along with some of the current Hamas leaders, said Hezbollah saw the strike in Beirut as a “violation of all rules of engagement” because it targeted a civilian residential area and because Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur was targeted “in his home rather than in a military headquarters.”Hezbollah, he said, “has developed many equations,” including that the response to a strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs will be in Haifa.For Iran, the situation is more complicated.In some ways, the current moment mirrors the time in April when Israel and Iran risked plunging into a war after Israel hit an Iranian consular building in Damascus, killing two Iranian generals. Iran retaliated with an unprecedented direct strike on Israel. At that time, diplomatic efforts managed to contain the escalation. But there are key differences. The assassination of Haniyeh took place on Iranian soil, embarrassing Tehran and making clear that Israel can easily hit targets there. While some analysts believe that will be mitigated by the fact the target was not an Iranian figure, Iranian officials have vowed a harsh response.Krieg said that while Haniyeh’s death was “damaging reputationally” for Iran and “humiliating” because it showed that Tehran was unable to protect high-profile visitors, “Haniyeh is not an integral part of the axis of resistance.”“His death has no strategic implications for Iran other than it being a sl in the face because you’re the host and your guest was killed while you were on watch,” he said.As such, Krieg said he believes Iran could choose to mitigate its response.Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an associate fellow in the International Security Programme at Chatham House, said Iran might turn to its proxies to retaliate.“They have got their people, training, arming, planning everywhere, and they can reach anywhere in the world,” she said. “They can also hit Israeli or Jewish targets globally.”Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said he expects Iran’s response to be another direct hit on Israel.The strike on Haniyeh “wasn’t just on Iranian territory, it was in Tehran,” he said. “It was at the inauguration. It doesn’t matter who was targeted” and whether or not the target was Iranian.Iranians, he said, are likely feeling that “if the demonstration of force in April managed to restore deterrence in the short run, that deterrence is now gone” and that they are “going to have do way more than what they did in April in order to be able to restore the balance of power.”The exchange in April did not spiral because of the diplomatic intervention by the United States and others, and the Iranian strike itself peared carefully choreogrhed to cause minimal damage.Still, Parsi said, there was also “a lot of luck” that went into keeping the escalation limited.“It’s a pivotal moment in this conflict. I don’t think we’ve been in as difficult a moment in this conflict, given that we’ve seen what Iran is cable of in April,” Bar-Yaacov said.If the response to the strikes does not cause Israeli casualties, a wider war could still be avoided, Ali said.But, he added, “We are in the territory of too many ‘ifs’ to avoid a war, and this doesn’t bode well.”___ writers Sarah El Deeb in Beirut and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-iran-hamas-hezbollah-haniyeh-262194a2d70273207ed1d1a5cb9ab09b,apnews,Agree,Agree,-4,0,-4.0,0.0,Agree,Agree,The article provides a detailed account of the strikes and their implications without showing clear support for either the Democrat or Republican party.

248c6b183f7fcbbf60bba8c1c696550d,"The Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan transnational crime syndicate now terrorizing several U.S. cities, established a firm criminal presence after socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro emptied Venezuela’s prisons in late 2023. In recent years, the Tren de Aragua spread its presence across several Latin American countries such as Colombia, Chile, and Peru before reaching the United States, with several of its members passing through the U.S. southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) began tracking Tren de Aragua encounters at the border as early as March 2023. The gang, which originally began in 2012 as a local trade union in the eponymous state of Aragua, evolved into a full-fledged crime syndicate over the past decade under the auspices of the Maduro regime, with which it is believed to maintain deep ties. Tren de Aragua’s extensive list of crimes are believed to range from theft, homicide, extortion, contraband, and kidnping to drug, human, and arms trafficking. The gang achieved its dramatic expansion notably in part due to the Venezuelan socialists’ prison policies, which granted the country’s main gangs full internal control of the inmate facilities, ruling them under a pseudo-fiefdom system locally known as the Pranato (“Pranate”). The Maduro regime’s lenient prison policies, together with the Pranate system — which features its own extensive lexicon based on the language of the pran, or “thug” — effectively allowed gang leaders to orchestrate criminal activities from within prisons. The gangs rampantly engaging in extortion, kidnpings, and robberies, among other crimes, with parent impunity, while the Venezuelan National Guard safeguards the gang-controlled prisons from outside attack. Under the Tren de Aragua’s Pranate of the Tocorón prison, located in Aragua, the gang’s founder and leader Héctor “The Child” Guerrero oversaw the group’s criminal activities and its international expansion across Latin America, which reportedly began in 2018. Guerrero, as the prison’s pran, also oversaw Tocorón’s internal transformation, turning it into the main headquarters of the gang with “amenities” including its own zoo, baseball field, bars, a casino, a nightclub, a bank, a pool, playgrounds, and its own cryptocurrency farm. The gang’s international expansion is believed to have started in places such as the Colombian town of La Parada, where the gang engaged in the extortion, smuggling, and sexual trafficking of Venezuelan migrants fleeing from socialism in what is now considered to be the worst migrant crisis in the Western Hemisphere. In September, the Maduro regime “raided” Tocorón and “dismantled” the gang after years of parent indifference towards Tren de Aragua and its extensive criminal activities. The “raid” concluded with Tocorón emptied of its inmates as part of a broader “security” initiative known as the Cacique Guaicaipuro Liberation Operation that resulted in other prisons, such as the Tocuyito prison — at the time Venezuela’s most populated prison — also emptied of its inmates. Experts believe that the Maduro regime negotiated with Guerrero before the “raid,” allowing him and his top brass to safely esce through a series of tunnels that connected the inmate center with the nearby Lake Valencia. Gang members had frequently used the tunnels to freely come and go from the prison at their leisure. Guerrero’s whereabouts remain unknown at press time. Authorities from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office in Chicago, Illinois, reportedly confirmed the presence of Tren de Aragua’s gang members in the city since at least October 2023 — weeks after the “raid” of Tocorón. In the months following the “raid,” other U.S. cities began reporting criminal acts linked to the gang. U.S. authorities have confirmed the active presence of Tren de Aragua in other cities such as Miami, New York, Dallas, and Atlanta. According to internal documentation from the Department of Homeland Security, Tren de Aragua has given the “green light” to its members to attack U.S. law enforcement officers. The city of Aurora, Colorado, which neighbors sanctuary city Denver, also reported the presence of the gang in its territory, taking over entire artment complexes. The Aurora police department announced last week the creation of a joint task force with both Colorado’s state patrol and the state’s Bureau of Investigation to address the growing threat of Tren de Aragua in the state. In May, law enforcement authorities in Louisiana dismantled a sex trafficking network linked to Tren de Aragua that arranged for its victims to be smuggled into the United States after teaching them how to request asylum at the southern border. The sex trafficking gang then forced the victims into prostitution to pay for the “debt” accrued from smuggling them into the United States. The Maduro regime’s official “stance” on the Tren de Aragua pears to vary depending on what suits them at a specific moment. Several of the rogue socialist regime’s members, such as Foreign Minister Yvan Gil and Attorney General Tarek William Saab repeatedly insisted throughout the year that Tren de Aragua “does not exist” and is part of an alleged international smear campaign to hurt the rogue regime’s image. Last week, Gil claimed that Tren de Aragua — which according to him does not exist — is allegedly working with the Venezuelan opposition to stage a coup against dictator Nicolás Maduro following his fraudulent presidential “reelection” in July. Reports published in April indicated that the Maduro regime employed the gang to hunt down Venezuelan dissidents in foreign countries. Venezuelan dissident Ronald Ojeda was abducted from his residence in Santiago, Chile, in late February by individuals linked to the Tren de Aragua. Ojeda’s body was found buried inside a suitcase under a concrete structure ten days after his abduction. In April, Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich denounced Tren de Aragua as a state-sponsored terrorist group, asserting that its criminal actions as “not autonomous” from that of the socialist Maduro regime. “The Tren de Aragua does not strike in just any way. The Tren de Aragua strikes with a procedure, with a matrix of operation, with a logic that always does exactly the same thing,” Bullrich explained at the time. “It settles in a certain place. It comes with a group in general of Venezuelan nationality.” “Consequently, it is important to analyze whether it is an organization that is autonomous from the state or not autonomous from the state. I tend to think that it is not autonomous from the state,” she continued. The Tocorón and Tocuyito prisons emptied by the Venezuelan socialists last year will soon serve as the Maduro regime’s new “re-education centers” for anti-socialists. The refurbishing is part of the Maduro regime’s ongoing brutal crackdown following the July 28 sham presidential election, which Maduro fraudulently insists he “won.” The arrival of dissidents to the two prisons reportedly started this week — including groups of minors that the Maduro regime has detained through the ongoing dissident crackdown.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Leave it to MSNBC to ferret out ""The biggest difference between Trump's and Harris' economic pitches."" According to a recent MSNBC opinion piece with that title, ""Trump is obsessed with the macroeconomics, big-picture, 10,000-foot view of the economy"" while Harris offers a ""microeconomic pitch,"" with specific polices to improve Americans’ economic circumstances. Respectfully, the piece does not make the point its author thought he was making. Particularly in this election year, no one should criticize a presidential candidate as ""obsessed"" with addressing macroeconomic issues such as inflation, wages, interest rates, economic growth and the deficit. Former President rump was welcomed onstage by Pennsylvania steelworkers, who gave him a commemorative hard hat. (Pool)The Biden/Harris administration’s failure to effectively address these very issues resulted in massive inflation, declining real wages, stifling interest rates, a surging federal deficit, and an almost incomprehensibly large national debt. KAMALA HARRIS WANTS AMERICA TO HAVE THE WORLD'S HIGHEST DEATH TAXAmerican voters will likely insist that the next president have a better plan to address those issues. And there’s the rub – Harris doesn’t have one. She has unabashedly praised the current plan, a failed big government hodgepodge of massive spending and increased regulatory pressure called Bidenomics. In fact, when asked in a recent interview how she would govern differently from Biden, she conceded that ""nothing comes to mind."" So much for being the change candidate.Lacking an effective macroeconomic plan, Harris has opted for targeted policies designed to assuage voter groups Biden/Harris economic policies have harmed – that’s the so-called ""microeconomic pitch."" KAMALA HARRIS CLAIMS SHE SUPPORTS SMALL BUSINESS. SHE DOESN'T AND I HAVE THE RECEIPTSFeel like grocery prices are too high with inflation up over 20%? Harris will attack nonexistent price gouging to show she cares.Can’t afford that new home with interest rates triple what they were when she took office? Harris will give you $25,000 to ease the pain.Are you trying to support yourself and your parents in the inflation-ridden Biden/Harris economy? Harris will expand Medicare to reduce that pain. Harris’ latest concern is that she’s losing the votes of Black men, many of whom are supporting Trump with his proven record of providing jobs and opportunity and increasing real wages. That is, policies that empower them to improve their lives. KAMALA HARRIS, YOU CAN'T RUN FROM AMERICA'S COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS. AND YOUR PRICE-GOUGING CLAIMS EQUAL NO SALESo, Harris is offering what she calls an ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,"" including ""fully forgivable"" loans of ""up to $20,000"" for ""Black entrepreneurs,"" and the legalization of ""recreational marijuana"" to create ""opportunities for Black Americans"" in this ""new industry."" Seriously, free money and legal marijuana. You couldn’t credibly make this up.Even Left-leaning economists, media outlets and campaign surrogates have criticized many of these policies as political pandering, gimmicks, unrealistic or simply bad economics – and they are. But the real problem is not with a particular policy’s merits or demerits. The problem is that Harris has no consistent economy wide (that is macroeconomic) plan. Rather, like the little Dutch boy, Harris’ proach is to put her fingers in the economic dam to assuage specific suffering voter groups – hoping that the macroeconomic dam doesn’t break, at least not before the election.BIDENOMICS ARCHITECT IS KAMALA’S ECONOMIC WHISPERERMSNBC did get one thing right – Trump is obsessed with macroeconomic issues. His plan is to spur economic growth by cutting taxes, slashing growth killing regulations, and incentivizing domestic energy production, including fossil fuels.It’s a plan that will improve the overall economy, benefiting all Americans regardless of their income, race or sex as it did in his first term. To parhrase President Kennedy, a rising economic tide lifts all boats. Trump has a rising tide economic plan. Harris does not.To blunt Trump’s macroeconomic advantage, the MSNBC piece criticizes Trump’s ""bid to end taxes on overtime pay"" as ""pandering."" But tax cuts are an important part of Trump’s macroeconomic plan. Trump wants to cut taxes for everyone – particularly people who work hard (no tax on overtime), provide superior service (no tax on tips), or have worked hard all their lives (no tax on Social Security benefits). These tax cuts target no race or sex and have the advantage of being good both economically and politically. In fact, Harris has already adopted Trump’s no tax on tips proposal as her own. Something the MSNBC piece ignores. Finally, the MSNBC piece claims that Trump’s ""absolutely favorite"" economic solution ""is to sl crippling tariffs on imports to the U.S."" But if tariffs are so crippling, why did the Biden/Harris administration keep in place Trump’s tariffs from his first term and then dramatically increase them in September to 100% on electric vehicles, 50% on solar cells and 25% on electrical vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes. Not to mention increased tariffs on other products, including semiconductor chips, over the next two years. Well, here’s why – according to Biden/Harris administration Trade Representative Katherine Tai, these stiff tariff increases are a ""legitimate and constructive"" tool for re-invigorating U.S. businesses.

2643c0b928e81e54cc2a0bbb1bc88ac2,"Updated Oct. 29, 2024 12:08 am ETA Standard Missile is launched from the USS McCampbell during a flight test off the coast of the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. WASHINGTON—The U.S. is running low on some types of air-defense missiles, raising questions about the Pentagon’s readiness to respond to the continuing wars in the Middle East and Europe and a potential conflict in the Pacific.Interceptors are fast becoming the most sought-after ordnance during the widening crisis in the Middle East, as Israel and other U.S. allies face an increasing threat from missiles and drones fired by Iran and the militias it supports. The shortfall could become even more urgent after Israel’s Friday night strikes on Iran, which U.S. officials fear might spark another wave of attacks by Tehran.Standard Missiles, which are usually ship-launched and come in various types, are among the most common interceptors the U.S. has used to defend Israeli territory from Iranian missile attacks, and are critical for stopping Houthi attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea. The U.S. has launched more than 100 Standard Missiles since Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel, the U.S. officials said.The oil tanker Sounion in August after it was attacked in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels.The Defense Department says it doesn’t publicly disclose its stockpiles because the information is classified and could be leveraged by Iran and its proxies.“Over the course of the last year, the Department of Defense has augmented our force posture in the region to protect U.S. forces and support the defense of Israel, while always taking into account U.S. readiness and stockpiles,” Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said.The heavy use of the Pentagon’s limited stockpile of missile interceptors is raising concerns about the ability of the U.S. and its allies to keep pace with unexpected, high demand created by the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. The Pentagon worries it could run through its inventory faster than it can replace them, leaving the U.S. vulnerable in a potential conflict in the Pacific, analysts and officials said.“The U.S. has not developed a defense industrial base intended for a large-scale war of attrition in both Europe and the Middle East, while meeting its own readiness standards,” said Elias Yousif, a fellow and deputy director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center in Washington. “And both of those wars are extended conflicts, which was not part of the U.S. defense planning.”Increasing production of weons has proved difficult for the Pentagon, since it often requires that companies open new production lines, expand facilities and hire additional workers. Companies are often reluctant to invest in that expansion without knowing that the Pentagon is committing to buying at increased levels over the long term.Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro.Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told lawmakers in May testimony that he was pressing industry to increase production of Standard Missiles because the U.S. had deployed so many interceptors in the Middle East. There are “some increases” in two variants of Standard Missiles, he said, but acknowledged the difficulty of ramping up production. “The more sophisticated the missile, the harder it is to produce them,” he said.The concerns over a shortage of interceptors have prompted senior Pentagon officials, including Del Toro, and Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, to look at alternate technology, including drawing on newer companies to help increase production of new types of air-defense missiles. The U.S. had built up interceptor stocks over recent years, but the U.S. in any one month of the conflict in the Middle East has launched dozens of missiles, and production cacity can’t keep up, according to analysts and defense officials.RTX, producer of the Standard Missiles, can make a maximum of a few hundred a year, a U.S. defense official said. That production, however, isn’t all for the Pentagon, since at least 14 allies also buy Standard Missiles, according to RTX.The company declined to comment on its production cacity, but RTX spokesman Chris Johnson said, “We work closely with the Department of Defense to meet their production needs for Standard Missiles.”Since the war between Hamas and Israel began last year, U.S. ships have launched more than $1.8 billion worth of interceptors to stop Iran and its proxies from attacking Israel and ships traveling through the Red Sea, according to the Navy.The Navy often launches two interceptors for every one missile when responding to attacks, essentially as an insurance policy to ensure the target is hit. A single Standard Missile can cost millions of dollars, making it an expensive way to defend against Iranian-made weons, which cost much less.“Those are really expensive munitions to shoot down crpy Houthi targets,” one congressional official said, “and every one they expend takes months to replace—and at high, high cost.”The U.S. launched a dozen Standard Missiles during Iran’s Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, in addition to employing other air-defense systems, but American and Israeli forces let through some of the 180 Iranian missiles that they knew wouldn’t strike valuable sites to preserve its stock of interceptors, U.S. officials said.A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad system, launching station in Israel in 2019.Earlier this month, in the run-up to Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran, the Pentagon deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad system, to Israel, a move that allows the U.S. to use interceptors other than Standard Missiles to bolster Israel’s defenses. The Pentagon has also moved additional Patriot missile-defense systems to the Middle East, which required shuffling around the limited number of batteries it has in inventory to also meet the demand in Ukraine.Pentagon officials said the plan is to maintain the current overall production levels of the Standard Missiles, though there will be cuts to some of the older variants to fund newer ones.The heavy use of weons such as interceptors in the Middle East is also putting at risk the Pentagon’s ability to fight in the Pacific, said Mark Montgomery, a retired rear admiral and now a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative think tank in Washington. “We’re spending a year’s worth of Standard Missiles—those are standard missiles that are supposed to be part of rearming ourselves for China,” he said. “So, 100%, we have, once again in the Middle East, set back Navy readiness to execute operations in the Pacific.”Israel’s military has some of the most advanced air defense systems in the world in its arsenal. Here’s how the U.S.-deployed Thaad will bolster it even further.

If so, sign up here. And make sure you’re subscribing to the Campaign Moment podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever else.)The big momentAfter much hand-wringing about Vice President Kamala Harris’s lack of unscripted interviews since joining the 2024 race at the top of the ticket, Harris has in recent days undertaken a veritable media blitz. She’s gone on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and on Howard Stern’s show, on “The View” and on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show.A few reflections on the key moments, what she said, and what we learned.Vice President Kamala Harris embarked on a media blitz this week, pearing on a variety of national TV, radio and podcast shows. Here are the key moments. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)Harris’s answer on Biden could be a problemEven while talking to generally sympathetic hosts in most of these interviews, Harris reinforced the idea that she can create problems for herself in these unscripted settings. The primary example may be her answer about President Joe Biden.Asked on “The View” what she might have done differently from Biden, Harris responded: “There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of — and I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.”That’s undoubtedly not how her campaign drew it up.It’s not an easy question, given that Harris is still serving with Biden. But it’s also clear she needs to carve out some distance between herself and Biden, given how unpopular he is. And there’s a way to massage it without giving Republicans such a potent video clip (a clip at least one House Republican is already using in an ad). For instance, at the debate last month, Harris said, “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.”Harris seemed to recognize that stumble Tuesday, emphasizing later in the show that unlike Biden she would point a Republican to her Cabinet.Harris’s “60 Minutes” interview also featured plenty of pressing from host Bill Whitaker. Harris resisted and talked around his questions, or offered some of those wordy, convoluted answers Republicans have attacked her for — particularly on Israel.Her big pitch: StrengthThis was a theme running through her pearances, as Harris perhs sought to overcome questions about whether the country is prepared to elect a woman as president:On “Call Her Daddy,” Harris responded to a reminder that Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) questioned Harris’s humility by subtly pointing to Harris’s lack of biological children: “I don’t think she understands that, there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,” Harris said.On Stern’s show, Harris asserted that she was proud of putting “a lot of people in jail” and said of threats she faced as a prosecutor, “I refuse to live in fear of the bad guys.”On “60 Minutes,” she disclosed that the gun she owns is a Glock — a stereotypically gritty firearm. (Harris previously told Oprah Winfrey, “If somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot.”)Harris also made a direct play for the mantle of strength in the Stern interview.“Ultimately, I do believe that this is an election that is about strength versus weakness, and weakness as projected by someone who puts himself in front of the American people and does not have the strength to stand in defense of their needs, their dreams, their desires …” Harris said, while also pitching herself as stronger on national security and foreign policy.Her campaign soon promoted that segment of the interview.Her pearances reflected the changing media paradigmRarely have we seen a blitz that is so strategically and transparently geared toward specific constituencies and reaching large audiences, including by using nontraditional forums.The “60 Minutes” and Colbert pearances are par-for-the-course for a presidential candidate, with the former being the long-running highest-ranked news show. But “Call Her Daddy” — an often raunchy, sex-themed show — is a massively popular and generally olitical show with a huge audience among young women (it’s Spotify’s most popular podcast among women). “The View” was obviously about pealing to women, specifically. And the Stern show, like “Call Her Daddy,” gave Harris an avenue to lots of less-engaged voters.The potential downside of some of these shows is Harris associating herself with their often-vulgar content. But that ship probably sailed in our politics a long time ago; Trump was a regular guest on Stern’s show for years.Watch the funny moments from Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz's media pearances as they embarked on a media blitz this week. (Video: Ross Godwin, Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)This could put pressure on Trump to branch outWhile there’s been plenty of talk about Harris’s not doing interviews, her recent foray might cause Republicans and the Trump campaign to rethink their own media strategy.Harris has given few interviews, but she is now speaking to shows that could reach lots of casual and undecided voters. Trump … is not really doing that right now. His media-interview diet is heavier, but it’s focused on preaching to the choir, going on Fox News and Newsmax and the like. (He did go on young-male influencers Theo Von’s and Adin Ross’s popular shows in August.) Trump also turned down the forum “60 Minutes” offered because he didn’t want to be fact-checked.That decision broke a tradition for major-party presidential candidates dating back to 1968.It’s clear Trump is much more comfortable at rallies and with friendly interviewers; he makes so many false claims that branching out and actually being pressed is not a recipe for success. But there would seem to be a premium on speaking to the broader electorate with undecided voters looming so large late in the campaign.And Harris basically challenged him to do that. Her answer on strength came on a show Trump used to frequent, and after Stern noted Trump had turned down “60 Minutes.”A brief moment on hurricane politicsThe big national story right now is, of course, Hurricane Milton. Our thoughts go out to the Floridians who will soon be struck by this hurricane in Florida, as well as to those still recovering from Hurricane Helene in Georgia, North Carolina and other states.It seems crass to talk about politics at a moment like this. But the campaigns and government officials are already confronting what this means for the vote in 2024 to have a pair of hurricanes strike three key states so late in a presidential election — a situation with little if any precedent. North Carolina officials have quickly moved to ease voting changes, for example.On Tuesday, I looked at the history of how hurricanes can affect voting. Here are a few key points:Hurricanes can lead to a drop in turnout: Hurricane Katrina in 2005 led to more than a 10 percent drop in turnout in New Orleans eight months later, as half the city was still displaced. Hurricane Michael late in the 2018 election led to a 7 percent drop in turnout in the affected areas of Florida’s panhandle, amid confusion about polling places.That’s particularly problematic for Trump, given the areas hard-hit by Helene tend to be Republican-leaning. Trump addressed this Monday night, saying, “I believe they’re going to go out and vote if they have to crawl to a voting booth. He added that “we’re trying to make it convenient for them to [vote], but they just lost their house.”A hurricane response can also affect views of incumbents. That effect peared to help Barack Obama in 2012 after Superstorm Sandy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in 2022 after Hurricane Ian, while it hurt the Republican Party in 2006 (after Katrina) and George H.W. Bush in 1992 after Hurricane Andrew.Stay tuned. Politics are not the primary concern right now. But these are crucial states — as The Post’s polling averages demonstrate — in a 2024 election which has major consequences for the country, and these hurricanes have thrown everyone a major late curveball.A pair of momentous poll numbers2 percent and 5 percentThose are Harris’s edges on Trump in a New York Times/Siena College poll when it comes to which of the two candidates was more likely to “help you personally” and “help people like you,” respectively.While those aren’t big gs, this is the kind of question that has normally favored Trump. A Times/Siena poll just last month showed voters in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina said by an 11-point margin that Trump’s policies would help them rather than hurt them, but by a five-point margin that Harris’s policies would hurt them.Even in the new national poll, voters said by 12 points that Trump’s policies as president had helped rather than hurt them, and by 20 points that President Joe Biden’s policies had done more to hurt them.Why this is significant: There are few things that are as immediate a concern for voters as whether a candidate would help or hurt them. And Trump’s advantages on questions like this have helped him overcome concerns about his character. If Harris can truly erase this deficit, that could be huge for her.Take a moment to read:",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/09/campaign-moment,washingtonpost,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,0,-1,0.0,0.0,Disagree,Agree,"The article appears to have a slight leaning towards the Democratic party.

36234774df06e7076409ec9b557f663e,"If you didn’t know any better, you might think, from recent media coverage, that the problem with Donald Trump’s proposal to round up and expel as many as 20 million immigrants is that it’s not likely to work.The Republican presidential nominee has made the mass deportation pledge central to his case for a second term. On the campaign trail, he diverts every question, no matter what the issue, back to the supposed danger and malignancy of immigrants and the urgency of getting rid of them. The economy? It will be better when there are fewer immigrants competing for jobs, he says. Housing prices? They’ll come down when millions of people are kicked out of the country, he claims. Crime will come down when the immigrants are gone, he says, because murder is “in their genes”.The vision he is offering is profoundly racist: Trump’s proposal, which is not limited to undocumented immigrants, is based on the assumption that nonwhite people are the cause of all of the US’s problems, and that everything that is wrong will be made right as soon as they’re gone. His proposed solution to everything – from crime to housing costs to inflation – is to deploy the armed forces to literally round up our friends, family members and neighbors by the millions, in a vast program of ethnic cleansing.It is a terrifying, horrifically immoral, and contemptibly bigoted proposal; racist, indifferent to humanity, and hostile to the principles of pluralism and equality. If it was enacted, it would be among the worst human rights catastrophes of all time. It would destroy families and lives, tear communities art, inculcate ethnic hatred and distrust. To be accomplished, it would also practically require tremendous amounts of violence and force. Some of those marked for forced removal would hide, and some of their friends would turn them in. Worksites and immigrant neighborhoods would be raided, as cops flooded in and innocent people scattered. Mothers and fathers would be ripped from the arms of their screaming children. There is no other way to accomplish what Trump wants to accomplish: what he is proposing would require atrocity.For him, this may in fact be the point. At the Republican national convention last summer, the crowd in Milwaukee smiled as they held signs aloft reading “MASS DEPORTATION NOW”. Trump’s peal has always been this vision of a future that, through violence, can be made to look more like what these people imagine of the United States’ past – namely, one with many fewer people of color in it.But what is strange about the coverage of Trump’s mass deportation plan is how little its moral perversity has factored into coverage, either by the media or in the attacks lobbed at it by Democrats.CBS and NBC, for their part, seem to have determined that Trump’s pivot to calling for a gigantic scale ethnic cleansing operation is not in itself newsworthy. Instead, they have run stories pointing out that the plan would be expensive and logistically difficult, with the federal enforcement agencies requiring an estimated $216bn in funding to deport the US’s roughly 11 million undocumented people over the next four years. (Ice, they note, received a comparatively paltry $9bn last year.)Construction, agriculture, real estate development business leaders, they note, are skeptical at the idea, noting how much of their own labor force is composed of immigrants: they claim, probably correctly, that the move would lead to large increases in housing and food costs. And economists worry that the broader impact on the economy could be devastating: one economic thinktank found that deporting 1.3 million immigrants would reduce jobs for native-born workers, increasing unemployment by 0.8%.For their part, the Harris campaign has largely taken this line on the issue, preferring to focus on Trump’s mass deportation plan not as a moral horror but as an irresponsible economic move. This is the line taken by Harris campaign surrogate and billionaire Mark Cuban, who has made the threats to the labor force posed by Trump’s plan a key part of his pitch to Harris-skeptical small business owners in swing states.This all may be true enough. It is likely that a mass deportation effort would not only strain the resources of the federal government, but also gut the US private sector labor force, not to mention the disruptions it would cause to productivity when, say, an underslept mother is slow or weepy at her shift because the father of her children was taken from their home by goons. It is likely, too, that the number of jobs created by the mass deportation scheme – the cops and thugs who will be needed to round up the immigrants, the lawyers and judges who will be needed to shove them through the court system, the chefs and guards and drivers who will be needed to feed and transport and monitor them inside the internment camps that such a project will inevitably require – will likely not provide enough jobs to offset the lost tax revenue.But there is something morally depraved about talking about Trump’s plan in these terms. The cost of mass deportation cannot be measured only in whether it will be beneficial or detrimental to the pocketbooks of native-born Americans: doing so supposes both that only those born in the US are worthy of concern, and also that the only thing we have to lose is money. What is being proposed is a vast cruelty, a human tragedy, and a costly national investment in racism. That we are speaking of this proposal in primarily economic terms, rather than moral ones, suggests that the cost to the US has already been quite high.

3a2830ab2b423cb781a36c5d651b1e86,"When women's basketball star Brittney Griner was released in December 2022 from the Russian prison system — traded for convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout — the nation's eyes turned to the man who was left behind: Michigan's Paul Whelan.A year and a half later, Whelan was freed Thursday in a deal that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who also was wrongfully detained on spying charges the U.S. government says he didn’t commit.More:Biggest prisoner sw since the Cold War could be underway, movements suggestWhelan, a former Marine who lived in Novi, was the head of global security for BorgWarner when he was arrested Dec. 28, 2018. He has been imprisoned in Russia, accused of espionage. He was convicted in June 2020 during a closed-door trial and sentenced to 16 years of hard labor in a work camp.This is his story.Who is Paul Whelan?Paul Nicholas Whelan was born in March 1970 in Ottawa, Ontario — Canada's national cital. His parents, Edward and Rosemary Whelan, immigrated to Canada from Britain.He has a twin brother, David; a sister, Elizabeth; and another brother, Andrew. The family moved to Ann Arbor when the twins were young; they went on to graduate in Huron High School's Class of 1988.Whelan is now a U.S. citizen but holds passports in four countries — the U.S.; his native Canada; Britain, where his parents were born; and Ireland, where his grandparents were born. He never married and has no children.He testified in a 2013 court deposition that he worked as a Chelsea police officer in 1988-2000, and also worked for the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office. Whelan joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves on , according to his service record.Whelan was hired in 2001 by Kelly Services, a Troy-based company that offers consulting and temporary workers to businesses around the world. He took a military leave of absence from Kelly Services in 2003-08 to serve in Iraq, he testified.At Kelly Services, Whelan's title was senior manager of global security and investigations. His job included campus security as well as electronic and IT-related security.He started working in early 2017 for BorgWarner, company spokeswoman Kathy Graham told the Free Press in a previous interview. Whelan was global security chief when he was arrested and accused of spying.According to business licensing records, Whelan also ran an online firearms business known as Kingsmead Arsenal. The business was started in 2012. He also testified in the 2013 deposition that he has a federal firearms license. Was Paul Whelan given a bad-conduct discharge from the Marines?Yes. Whelan worked as an administrative clerk and administrative chief and was deployed in the war against Iraq in 2004 and 2006.He rose to the rank of staff sergeant in December 2004, but a few years later was convicted in a special court-martial of attempting to steal more than $10,000 while at Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. Other related convictions included dereliction of duty, making a false official statement, wrongfully using other people's Social Security numbers and bouncing checks.He was given a bad-conduct discharge in December 2008 at the rank of private. Whelan's last place of duty was Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California.While stationed in Iraq, Whelan was part of “The Rest and Recuperation Leave Program,” which authorized 15 days of leave to service members on yearlong deployments to Iraq, according to a 2007 story posted on the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing page of the Marine Corps website. The military paid for the travel and most service members chose to return home, but others could travel abroad.Whelan spent his two weeks in Russia, saying in the interview that the leave program “gives those of us who are single an opportunity to travel throughout the world wherever we want to go and experience the diversity of culture.”During his military career, Whelan received awards that included the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation and Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.Novi District Court records show that Whelan was also involved in landlord-tenant disputes in 2007 over nonpayment of rent while he was on active service in the military. Court records also show a case was filed against Whelan in 2011 by a Norfolk, Virginia-based debt collector for $1,210.35.Was Paul Whelan a spy?The Russian Foreign Ministry alleges Whelan was caught ""red-handed"" in an act of espionage. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), a successor to the Soviet Union's KGB, says its agents found a USB drive containing classified information in Whelan's room at the swanky Metropol Hotel in Moscow. Whelan insists that he was set up, and that he was simply a tourist. He was there, he said, to attend the wedding of a friend, a fellow former Marine.In the days leading up to his arrest, he led tours of Moscow historical sites for the wedding party, David Whelan told the Free Press in a previous interview. And he shared Christmas dinner at a steakhouse in Moscow with a Russian man named Ilya Yatsenko, whom he'd met a decade earlier during one of his trips to the country.Over about a half-dozen visits to Russia since 2006, Whelan got to know Yatsenko — or so he thought — even visiting Yatsenko's parents and siblings in the town of Sergiev Posad, about 50 miles northeast of Moscow, David Whelan said.It was Yatsenko who gave Whelan key evidence in Russia's case against him: a USB drive containing government secrets, David Whelan alleges.""Paul expected there to be photogrhs on it and something else was put on that drive in order to entr him,"" he said. At the time, then-President Donald Trump made no public statements about Whelan's arrest. Trump administration officials made careful and measured statements about him.More than a year after her brother's arrest, Elizabeth Whelan said: ""This is ridiculous. Russia has a legal system but not a judicial system. Everybody knows that once you get on this conveyor belt, that the end result before you're popped off at the other end is 100% chance of conviction and sentencing.""She was right. Whelan was convicted of espionage in a Moscow courtroom in June 2020. John Sullivan, then-U.S. ambassador to Moscow, described the conviction as a ""mockery of justice."" Whelan was taken to IK-17, a gulag in the Republic of Mordovia, about an eight-hour drive southeast of Moscow. There, he spent hours each day cutting threads from newly made prison uniforms. He later was promoted to sewing buttonholes. The U.S. House and U.S. Senate both have passed resolutions demanding Whelan's release. The U.S. State Department now considers him wrongfully detained and has been insistent that his conviction was a sham.Does Paul Whelan's work history have ties to Russia?Though Whelan said he traveled to Russia as a tourist, he entered the country on a business travel visa supported by BorgWarner Inc., he told his lawyers in Moscow.The Auburn Hills-based auto supplier BorgWarner has 49,000 employees working among its 93 sites around the world, but spokeswoman Graham told the Free Press in 2019 that it didn't have any locations in Russia. The company would not confirm that it sponsored Whelan's Russian business visa.""As a general policy BorgWarner does not comment on travel of any of its employees, nor does the company discuss information about individual customers,"" said Graham in an email to the Free Press at the time. ""Paul was not in Russia on company business. We are deferring to the State Department regarding updates to his situation.""Although BorgWarner operates no facilities in Russia, the company does have a history of doing business there. BorgWarner supplied Kamaz Inc., Russia's largest truck-maker, with turbochargers, fan drives and high-performance fans, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission documents. BorgWarner parts are used in nonmilitary Kamaz trucks and Nefaz buses, and its total sales to Kamaz in 2013-15 through non-U.S. subsidiaries was $12.1 million.""For over 15 years, BorgWarner has supported (Kamaz) with advanced air-flow technologies, and we are looking forward to continuing the successful collaboration,"" Daniel Paterra, who was then BorgWarner's president and general manager of thermal systems, said in a 2015 news release about the Dakar Rally, an off-road rally in South America in which Kamaz trucks are used. What did Trump say about Whelan's case?Trump didn't speak publicly about Whelan's arrest during his time in office. But the former president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, in December 2022 to criticize the deal that President Joe Biden's administration made to sw Griner for Bout.""I turned down a deal with Russia for a one on one sw of the so-called Merchant of Death for Paul Whelan,"" Trump wrote. ""I wouldn’t have made the deal for a hundred people in exchange for someone that has killed untold numbers of people with his arms deals. I would have gotten Paul out, however, just as I did with a record number of other hostages. The deal for Griner is crazy and bad. The taking wouldn’t have even hpened during my Administration, but if it did, I would have gotten her out, fast!""David Whelan took to Twitter, saying: ""Former President Trump pears to have mentioned my brother #PaulWhelan's wrongful detention more in the last 24 hours than he did in the 2 years of his presidency in which Paul was held hostage by #Russia (zero). I don't suggest he cares now any more than he did then (zero)"".What did President Joe Biden do?Biden met with Elizabeth Whelan during the summer of 2022 to assure her of his commitment to freeing her brother.In the Dec. 8, 2022, announcement that Griner was coming home, Biden said: ""We’ve not forgotten about Paul Whelan. This was not a choice about which American to bring home. … Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's. ... We will never give up.""How did Paul Whelan's family respond when Griner was freed but he was not?Though they were dispointed that Whelan wasn't freed along with Griner, the family supported Biden's decision to make the one-on-one trade, David Whelan said.""There is no greater success than for a wrongful detainee to be freed and for them to go home,"" he said. ""The Biden administration made the right decision to bring Ms. Griner home, and to make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasn't going to hpen.""Since then, he said the family has been overwhelmed by the swell of support for his brother.""Even in these hyper-partisan days, we have received emails and donations from people of what seems to be all political perspectives sending Paul their best wishes and hope for a speedy return home. Americans pulling together for an American,"" David Whelan said.""Paul has continued to call home on a daily basis and speak to our parents. We have been sending him updates about the support shown through GoFundMe donations as well as the many people indicating they're writing him letters and cards. ... In the months ahead, those will bring Paul great comfort. If he ever worried that he'd been forgotten, I think this will provide Paul reassurance that he remains in people's prayers.""White House staff met virtually with Elizabeth Whelan in December 2022, who was told her brother's freedom remains ""as high a priority as the President has,"" David Whelan said.Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

3b97f4847a2883a57032efc57b4bd16d,"SKIP ADVERTISEMENTIsraeli Raids Paralyze Daily Life for Many in the West BankAs an Israeli offensive against Palestinian militant groups stretched to a 10th day, residents said many people were trped in their homes out of fear.Palestinians inspect a damaged car after an Israeli airstrike in the West Bank city of Tubas on Thursday....Alaa Badarneh/EPA, via ShutterstockSept. 5, 2024Five Palestinians were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their vehicles early Thursday, Palestinian news media said, as one of the longest and most destructive recent Israeli military raids in the occupied West Bank stretched into a ninth day across several cities.Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, reported the deaths, in the town of Far’a. They added to the toll of an already devastating military offensive, with at least 39 people killed in the raids and 145 others injured, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.The Israeli military said the strike in Far’a targeted armed fighters who hurled explosives and shot at security forces. It has described the raids as an effort to crack down on Palestinian armed groups and combat rising attacks against Israelis.Such raids have become a near-daily reality for the nearly three million Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed there since the Hamas-led attack on Israel last October, both in military strikes and at the hands of extremist Jewish settlers, according to the United Nations.Palestinian armed groups have claimed some of those killed in the ongoing Israeli raids as members. None claimed those killed in Far’a as members, and in a statement Hamas referred to them as “residents.”The nine days of military raids have taken an exceptional toll on Palestinians in several towns and cities, especially Jenin and Tulkarm, where many residents have trped in their homes for days, saying that Israeli forces are operating outside their doors with armored vehicles. Bulldozers have ripped up entire streets — in what the Israeli military calls an effort to unearth improvised explosives planted by armed groups — and snipers have taken up positions on rooftops and inside homes, residents have said.For five days, Kafah Abu Sarur, 49, and his family could not leave their home in the eastern part of Jenin as Israeli forces were spread through the streets. Their neighborhood has been raided before, including six months ago when Israeli soldiers stormed into their home and ransacked it, he said.“But this is the first time we see this kind of brutality,” said Mr. Abu Sarur, a father of seven, in an interview Thursday. “There is no humanity. They uprooted the trees, broke the buildings. The sewer mains meters under the ground, they ripped them up. The electricity, the water — they didn’t leave anything untouched.”A few days ago, he said, Israeli forces withdrew to the outskirts of their neighborhood. Mr. Abu Sarur ventured outside to get food and water for his family, his brother’s family and his parents, all of whom live in the same building.He found that the shops had been destroyed. With the roads impassable for vehicles, he saw volunteers bringing bread and other food into the neighborhood on foot.The Israeli military remains in other parts of the city, he said, including the neighborhood known as Jenin camp, which originated as a refugee camp for Palestinians who fled there after the creation of Israel in 1948 and is now a regular target of Israel’s military raids.Mr. Abu Sarur said his family was terrified that Israeli soldiers would return, and they all stay fully dressed at night in case troops storm in.Israeli soldiers entered Tulkarm again Thursday after briefly withdrawing from it hours earlier, said Faisal Salameh, head of the services committee in Tulkarm camp, a neighborhood of the city. For residents who had been trped in their homes for days, it was not enough time for them to step out to get provisions or check on loved ones.“No one had a chance to get anything done,” Mr. Salameh said. “The occupation left but returned quickly.”Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.SKIP ADVERTISEMENT",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/middleeast/israel-raids-west-bank-palestinians.html,nytimes,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,-5,-3,-5.0,0.0,Disagree,Agree,"The article highlights the suffering of Palestinians due to Israeli military actions, which aligns more with the Democrat party's generally more critical stance on Israeli policies and greater emphasis on human rights issues in the region.","The article has a negative tone as it describes the devastating impact of Israeli military raids on Palestinian civilians, including deaths, injuries, and destruction of property.

407fb1a06116bb8a8fdf5c70c1b5466e,"Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) sat down with Turning Point Action for a Gen-Z town hall in High Point, North Carolina, on Thursday, where he warned students that they “have more to lose than anybody” if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election, because “the consequences are going to fall hardest on the people in this room.” Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, touched upon the issues of foreign policy, illegal immigration, and unaffordable housing, and explained the ways in which they affect young people. “Younger voters have the most to lose or the most to gain from getting this election either right or wrong,” Vance told students, adding that Harris “doesn’t have strong or sincere views about what she actually wants to do.” Watch Below: Vance went on to explain that while he has “a lot” of policy disagreements with “a person like Barack Obama,” the one thing former Obama had that Harris doesn’t is “he actually has beliefs and thoughts in his head for how he wants to govern the United States of America.” “I don’t think you can say this about Kamala Harris,” Vance said, adding that when someone doesn’t have clear beliefs or thoughts about how they want to govern, they become “an empty vessel for whatever the prevailing ideas that are governing in Washington, DC, are.”By subscribing, you agree to our terms of use & privacy policy. You will receive email marketing messages from Breitbart News Network to the email you provide. You may unsubscribe at any time. And those prevailing ideas running through Washington, DC, include the notion “that we should use our young people as cannon fodder for foreign military misadventures,” he said. “I think you guys have a lot to lose, because we are on the precipice of many broad regional wars, potentially even a world war,” Vance continued. “Do you want a person like Kamala Harris negotiating in private rooms with people like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping? Or do you want a guy like Donald Trump actually sticking up for the United States of America?” “I think the answer to that question is obvious,” Vance asserted. Trump’s running mate added that another “prevailing idea in Washington, DC, is that we should let in millions upon millions of illegal immigrants, who compete against young Americans for important jobs, who undercut the wages of American workers.” “Why are homes unaffordable in the United States of America right now? Why have housing prices gone up by 45 percent in the state of North Carolina?” Vance asked. “The answer is that — one, we’re not building enough homes.” “If you look at Donald Trump’s regulatory policies vs. Kamala Harris’s regulatory policies — yes, if Donald Trump is president, we will build far more homes than we would if Kamala Harris is the president,” Vance elaborated. Moreover, the illegal immigration issue and housing issue are connected, the senator explained. “It’s important to recognize that no matter how many homes you build, if you allow an unlimited wave of illegal immigrants to come into the United States of America, those people are going to end up owning the houses or living in the houses that ought by right go to American citizens,” Vance said. “When you let in way too many illegal immigrants, the price of housing shoots through the roof,” he added. Vance then implored students to consider the following questions: “Do I want to have a job where I earn a good day’s wage for a good day’s work?” and “Do I want to raise a family in an environment — or just build a life in an environment — where I can afford to buy a home?” “Because if so, you’ve got to vote for Donald Trump,” Vance declared. “Kamala Harris’s policies are going to produce more war, more poverty, higher housing prices, and lower wages for American workers,” Vance warned. “You guys have more to lose than anybody,” Trump’s running mate said. “If we let the American Dream dispear in the United States of America, the consequences are going to fall hardest on the people in this room.” Alana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

4342d1a27ac318aadda2e196703a1708,"With less than three hours left in his presidency, Richard M. Nixon took the stage of the White House East Room to deliver his farewell speech 50 years ago Friday and tearfully showed a vulnerable side that few had seen him show in public before.“I think it was the first time that people really saw Richard Nixon, the man,” said Stephen Bull, who served as Nixon’s staff assistant at the time.The night before, on Aug. 8, 1974, Nixon had gone on TV and announced to the nation that he would be resigning as president in the wake of the Watergate scandal, effective noon the next day. He couldn’t sleep, and when he looked at his watch, it said 4 a.m. So he walked into the kitchen to get a glass of milk and was startled to see a White House steward making coffee, Nixon recalled in his book, “In the Arena: A Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal.”The president asked him what he was doing there so early.“It isn’t early, Mr. President. It’s almost six o’clock,” the steward replied.“My watch had stopped. After three years the battery had run down,” Nixon wrote — an t methor for his presidency.As he worked on the farewell address he would deliver to his Cabinet and staff that Friday morning, there was a knock on the door. It was his chief of staff, Alexander Haig, presenting him with a one-sentence letter, addressed to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The letter read: “I hereby resign the Office of President of the United States.”Nixon’s mind flashed back to one of his first days in the Oval Office in 1953, as vice president to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was about to sign some letters and documents.“He looked up at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, ‘Dammit, Dick, I wish my name weren’t so long!’” Nixon recalled in his memoir. “Mercifully, my name is short. I signed the letter.”Shortly after , Nixon, 61, walked into the East Room for his farewell address, accompanied by wife Pat Nixon; older daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and her husband, Edward Cox; and younger daughter Julie Eisenhower and her husband, David Eisenhower (the grandson of President Eisenhower).A band played “Hail to the Chief,” and hundreds of White House staffers and Cabinet members greeted Nixon with a three-minute standing ovation. The smiling president clasped his wife’s hand, pointed to someone in the crowd, clenched his fists a couple of times, and held two thumbs up before beginning his remarks.Nixon was a famously reserved leader, “an introvert in the extroverted calling of the politician,” as New York Times columnist Tom Wicker once observed. But in his farewell speech, he let his emotions out.“I recall speaking from the heart,” Nixon said in a 1983 interview with former White House aide Frank Gannon. “Tricia later, in her diary, which she let me see, wrote that for the first time she was glad people were able to see Daddy as he really was.”Shoulders hunched and eyes moist with tears, Nixon leavened his sad remarks with gallows humor. He made light of his debt to the Internal Revenue Service after it disallowed a $576,000 deduction for donating his vice-presidential pers to the National Archives.“I only wish that I were a wealthy man,” he said. “At the present time I've got to find a way to pay my taxes.” He chuckled as the audience laughed along with him.He recalled that his father was what people would call a “a little man, common man. … He was a streetcar motorman first and then he was a farmer and then he had a lemon ranch — it was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you. He sold it before they found oil on it.” The crowd laughed again.“And then he was a grocer,” Nixon continued. “But he was a great man, because he did his job, and every job counts up to the hilt regardless of what hpens.”His mother, Nixon said, “was a saint.”At one point in the speech, Nixon put on a pair of glasses to read a Theodore Roosevelt quote he said he had found “as I was reading my last night in the White House.” It was a diary passage about losing his young wife and mother on the same day. Nixon fought back tears after reading it.“That was T.R. in his 20s,” he said. “He thought the light had gone from his life forever, but he went on. And he not only became president, but as an ex‐president, he served his country always in the arena, tempestuous, strong, sometimes wrong, sometimes right. But he was a man. And as I leave, let me say, that's an example I think all of us should remember.”A couple of minutes later, he delivered perhs the most famous line of his speech, a recognition that his obsession with vanquishing his perceived enemies had brought him to this nadir:“Always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don’t win unless you hate them. And then you destroy yourself.”In The Washington Post the next day, Sally Quinn wrote that hardened reporters in the press room found themselves with mixed emotions.“I felt so angry at him for making me cry,” one unnamed reporter said. “He did it to himself. We didn’t do it.”Years later, daughter Julie Eisenhower told Barbara Walters of ABC News that her father’s speech “was very difficult because he was really letting down his guard for one of the few times in public — his voice cracking with emotion as he spoke about his parents and speaking about [how] a man is not defeated until he gives up.”“The critics panned my remarks, not surprisingly, as being too emotional,” Nixon recalled in his memoir. “They overlooked the fact that it was an emotional moment.”After the speech, Nixon and his wife walked to the White House lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and his wife, Betty Ford. Just before Nixon boarded the waiting helicopter, he waved and flashed his “V” gesture, for victory. The helicopter took him to Andrews Air Force Base for the ride home on Air Force One, which lost that designation at noon near Jefferson City, Mo., when Ford was sworn in as the new president.Bull, the staff assistant, said Nixon’s aides should have made more of an effort to help Nixon show his human side during his presidency. He flew back to California with Nixon and shared that feedback with the now ex-president.“I said to him, ‘I think the staff did you a great disservice,’” recounted Bull, now 82. “‘We always presented you as being one-dimensional, almost an automaton who is concerned only with the business at hand. And we never showed that you had emotions — humor, hpiness, depression, anger — all of the human emotions.’”Bull added, “The American people didn’t see that side of him, which I think ultimately worked against him in the public perception.”correctionAn earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Theodore Roosevelt lost his wife and baby on the same day.

5a7777e32338f5f39463ba65f838b10d,"In campaigning with former congresswoman Liz Cheney, the Harris campaign believes it is making a play for Republicans who can’t stomach former president Donald Trump. On this week’s episode of “Impromptu,” three of our conservative columnists — Megan McArdle, Jim Geraghty and Ramesh Ponnuru — talk about what they are hearing in their circles and wonder whether Vice President Kamala Harris is missing the mark.Use the audio player or The Post’s “Impromptu” podcast feed to listen to the entire conversation.Podcast episodeJim Geraghty: If you’re a center-right Republican, about the only thing the Harris-Walz campaign is offering that might be of interest to you is support for Ukraine. And it’s not like Harris talks about the need to support Ukraine at great length in any of her rallies. This is an abortion-focused, we’re-gonna-spend-money-everywhere, very-traditional-liberal-Democrat campaign.There’s really not a lot being offered to you in terms of policy. This is not a Bill Clinton, Democratic Leadership Council, Joe Lieberman type of campaign. And if you’re a conservative who’s alienated from the Trump era — by the Trump-style Republican Party — that would peal to you. But that’s not what’s on offer here.Ramesh Ponnuru: The Harris campaign has tacked to the center. But it’s a very odd tack to the center, which mostly consists of her staff repudiating positions she took during the 2019-2020 presidential primaries without any real explanation of why she has flipped on those issues. She has come closer to articulating some kind of explanation for it. But without that kind of account, it’s just much harder to trust the durability of this moderate shift.Follow Megan McArdleMegan McArdle: Yeah, I think it’s clear from her campaign that she wants to be president. But I don’t think it’s clear that she has reconsidered anything that she did in 2019. And I think that a lot of centrist Republicans do have a fear that’s the real Kamala Harris. And this business of quietly informing a friendly media reporter that “I don’t believe that anymore” — that’s probably not the best tack to take if you want to get Republicans on board.That said, I was talking to a conservative movement person the other day, and this person quietly admitted that they were not going vote for Harris because they don’t live in a swing state, but that they would probably be hpier if Harris was elected, and said that a lot of people they know feel that way.Listen to the full conversation here:Podcast episode",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/31/impromptu-podcast-harris-cheney-republicans,washingtonpost,Agree,Agree,-2,2,-2.0,2.0,Agree,Agree,"The article presents a critical view of Kamala Harris's campaign strategy, particularly in her attempt to appeal to center-right Republicans.

6c147f7c40ecbc5277187bed514d7669,"WASHINGTON - The party votes have been cast: Vice President Kamala Harris is officially the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee — making U.S. history as the first Black woman and first Asian American from a major party to win that designation.Harris secured the Democratic nomination on Friday afternoon, receiving the majority of votes — at least 2,350 — from her party's delegates, just one day after voting opened. The Democratic National Committee held a livestream video hosted by Biden campaign aides and DNC chairman Jaime Harrison to mark the occasion.""I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States,"" Harris said moments after she passed the delegate threshold during a Democratic party-sponsored livestream phone call. ""Your dedication cannot be overstated. Your dedication to our country. I know we all feel this way so strongly. We love our country, we believe in the promise of America, and that's what this campaign is about.""Harris said she will officially accept the nomination next week, once the virtual voting period concludes on Monday. She added that she's looking forward to the Democratic National Convention that begins Aug. 19 in Chicago to ""have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together.""Harris, 59, catulted to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election on July 21. Harris will go on to face Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the 45th president, in November.Vice President Harris quickly gained the backing of top leaders in her party, including Biden, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She's also been raking in record-breaking donations less than two weeks into her candidacy.The DNC began a virtual roll call on Thursday at 9 a.m. for delegates to vote for Harris as the party’s candidate. Delegates still have until the deadline on Monday, Aug. 5 at 6 p.m. ET to return their ballots.“I am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates and will be the nominee of the Democratic Party,” Harrison said during the livestream.He added: “Today, my friends, is special because we can proudly say that we will have the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket.”Even before voting opened, Harris had accumulated more than enough delegate support to win the nomination. Harris is expected to announce a vice presidential candidate before she is scheduled to pear in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her highly anticipated running mate. Additional stops next week for the duo are planned for western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Phoenix and Las Vegas.The DNC imposed an Aug. 7 deadline to virtually confirm the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month.With less than 100 days until the election, the race between the two candidates is heating up.Trump, the Republican nominee, and Harris are in a dead heat in several competitive, battleground states. The former president has come out swinging against the Democratic candidate. During a combative interview on Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists annual conference, Trump used racist rhetoric towards Harris, questioning her racial identity. Harris, who slammed Trump's remarks, is Black, and of South Asian descent.Harris is facing an uptick in racist and misogynistic attacks after she became the leading candidate for the Democrats.Trump and GOP allies have labeled Harris as a “DEI candidate” — a talking point using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion that conservatives are using to disqualify people of color or women who ascend to positions of power and influence. Days after Harris became the Democratic candidate, a video of Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, resurfaced that implied Harris was among top Democrats who were “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” Vance made those comments during an pearance on Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" in July 2021 while he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat.

6fd36df6fd5e6e62b8484424cc12a289,"TikTok was aware that its design features are detrimental to its young users and that publicly touted tools aimed at limiting kids’ time on the site were largely ineffective, according to internal documents and communications exposed in lawsuit filed by the state of Kentucky.The details are among redacted portions of Kentucky’s lawsuit that contains the internal communications and documents unearthed during a more than two year investigation into the company by various states across the country. Kentucky’s lawsuit was filed this week, alongside separate complaints brought forth by attorneys general in a dozen states as well as the District of Columbia. TikTok is also facing another lawsuit from the Department of Justice and is itself suing the Justice Department over a federal law that could ban it in the U.S. by mid-January. The redacted information — which was inadvertently revealed by Kentucky’s attorney general’s office and first reported by Kentucky Public Radio — touches on a range of topics, most importantly the extent to which TikTok knew how much time young users were spending on the platform and how sincere it was when rolling out tools aimed at curbing excessive use. Beyond TikTok use among minors, the complaint alleges the short-form video sharing p has prioritized “beautiful people” on its platform and has noted internally that some of the content-moderation metrics it has publicized are “largely misleading.” The unredacted complaint, which was seen by, was sealed by a Kentucky state judge on Wednesday after state officials filed an emergency motion to seal it. When reached for comment, TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said: “It is highly irresponsible of the to publish information that is under a court seal. Unfortunately, this complaint cherry-picks misleading quotes and takes outdated documents out of context to misrepresent our commitment to community safety.” “We have robust safeguards, which include proactively removing suspected underage users, and we have voluntarily launched safety features such as default screentime limits, family pairing, and privacy by default for minors under 16,” Haurek said in a prepared statement. “We stand by these efforts.” TikTok use among young usersThe complaint alleges that TikTok has quantified how long it takes for young users to get hooked on the platform, and shared the findings internally in presentations aimed at increasing user-retention rates. The “habit moment,” as TikTok calls it, occurs when users have watched 260 videos or more during the first week of having a TikTok account. This can hpen in under 35 minutes since some TikTok videos run as short as 8 seconds, the complaint says.Kentucky’s lawsuit also cites a spring 2020 presentation from TikTok that concluded that the platform had already “hit a ceiling” among young users. At that point, the company’s estimates showed at least 95% of smartphone users under 17 used TikTok at least monthly, the complaint notes.TikTok tracks metrics for young users, including how long young users spend watching videos and how many of them use the platform every day. The company uses the information it gleans from these reviews to feed its algorithm, which tailors content to people’s interests, and drives user engagement, the complaint says. TikTok does its own internal studies to find out how the platform is impacting users. The lawsuit cites one group within the company, called “TikTank,” which noted in an internal report that compulsive usage was “rampant” on the platform. It also quotes an unnamed executive who said kids watch TikTok because the algorithm is “really good.”“But I think we need to be cognizant of what it might mean for other opportunities. And when I say other opportunities, I literally mean sleep, and eating, and moving around the room, and looking at somebody in the eyes,” the unnamed executive said, according to the complaint.Time management toolsTikTok has a 60-minute daily screen time limit for minors, a feature it rolled out in March 2023 with the stated aim of helping teens manage their time on the platform. But Kentucky’s complaint argues that the time limit — which users can easily bypass or disable — was intended more as a public relations tool than anything else. The lawsuit says TikTok measured the success of the time limit feature not by whether it reduced the time teens spent on the platform, but by three other metrics — the first of which was “improving public trust in the TikTok platform via media coverage.” Reducing screen time among teens was not included as a success metric, the lawsuit said. In fact, it alleged the company had planned to “revisit the design” of the feature if the time-limit feature had caused teens to reduce their TikTok usage by more than 10%.TikTok ran an experiment and found the time-limit prompts shaved off just a minute and a half from the average time teens spent on the p — from 108.5 to 107 minutes per day, according to the complaint. But despite the lack of movement, TikTok did not try to make the feature more effective, Kentucky officials say. They allege the ineffectiveness of the feature was, in many ways, by design. The complaint says a TikTok executive named Zhu Wenjia gave proval to the feature only if its impact on TikTok’s “core metrics” were minimal.TikTok — including its CEO Shou Chew — have talked about the p’s various time management tools, including videos TikTok sends users to encourage them to get off the platform. But a TikTok executive said in an internal meeting those videos are “useful” talking points, but are “not altogether effective.”TikTok has ‘prioritized beautiful people’ on its platformIn a section that details the negative impacts TikTok’s facial filters can have on users, Kentucky alleges that TikTok’s algorithm has “prioritized beautiful people” despite knowing internally that content on the platform could “perpetuate a narrow beauty norm.”The complaint alleges TikTok changed its algorithm after an internal report noted the p was showing a high “volume of ... not attractive subjects” in the p’s main “For You” feed.“By changing the TikTok algorithm to show fewer ‘not attractive subjects’ in the For You feed, Defendants took active steps to promote a narrow beauty norm even though it could negatively impact their young users,” the complaint says.TikTok’s ‘leakage’ rates The lawsuit also takes aim at TikTok’s content-moderation practices.It cites internal communication where the company notes its moderation metrics are “largely misleading” because “we are good at moderating the content we cture, but these metrics do not account for the content that we miss.”The complaint notes that TikTok knows it has — but does not disclose — significant “leakage” rates, or content that violates the site’s community guidelines but is not removed or moderated. Other social media companies also face similar issues on their platforms. For TikTok, the complaint notes the “leakage” rates include roughly 36% of content that normalizes pedophilia and 50% of content that glorifies minor sexual assault. The lawsuit also accuses the company of misleading the public about its moderation and allowing some popular creators who were deemed to be “high value” to post content that violates the site’s guidelines.",https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-kids-teens-use-addiction-03a2d63a21bc5c1c62910628deff0521,apnews,Agree,Somewhat Agree,-4,2,-2.0,0.0,Disagree,Disagree,"The article appears to lean slightly towards the Republican party as it highlights issues with TikTok, a platform that has been under scrutiny by Republican lawmakers for its potential negative impact on youth and national security concerns.

But like many Olympians before her, and those competing at the 2024 Paris Games now, the realization that you're competing for something more than yourself was felt immediately for Walsh Jennings at her first Games in Athens in 2004. And though she wasn't competing in Paris this year, Walsh Jennings felt strong patriotism from those athletes she did encounter and watch during her time overseas. Kerri Walsh Jennings attends the Parity Paris Show at Opera Garnier on , in Paris, France. (Julien M. Hekimian/Getty s)""I did. It’s just something special,"" Walsh Jennings told Fox News Digital when asked whether she felt the pride for the United States in Paris. ""You see Scottie Scheffler when he won, and watching Team USA basketball, and they’re celebrities of the game.

Everyone who just helped me get there, and I brought them with me in my heart, and that’s a big deal. ""To be able to represent my country and put my hand on my heart and hear our anthem three times with Misty, and be able to fight for bronze with April [Ross], that was amazing.""Walsh Jennings also believes the Olympics reminds those in the United States, no matter whether you're an athlete at the Games or cheering on those who represent you, that American pride is never something to let go of. ""It’s OK to be proud of where you’re from,"" she said. ""No country is perfect.

""Santa Monica was it,"" Walsh Jennings, who partnered with Santa Monica Travel & Tourism ahead of the men's and women's beach finals in Paris, said. ""The sand is deep, it’s very clean, and it’s just where you want to be, because all the great ones played there, trained there and cut their teeth there.

853370e42e900b09368512f5e4e97c7d,"More than 100 members of Congress have signed on to a letter demanding that the United States conduct an independent investigation into the Israeli forces’ killing of Turkish American activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi earlier this month in the occupied West Bank, after the military alleged that its soldiers likely shot the young pro-Palestinian woman on accident.The Tuesday letter was drafted by Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat representing Eygi’s home state of Washington. A Seattle resident and recent University of Washington graduate, the 26-year-old activist was shot dead by Israeli forces on Sept. 6 while she was volunteering as an international observer for Palestinians engaging in a weekly protest against an illegal settlement expansion in the occupied territory’s village of Beita.After news of Eygi’s killing spread throughout the international community and the U.S., the Israeli Defense Forces said it would conduct a preliminary investigation into the shooting — a rare move by the military that even more rarely results in accountability. Upon conclusion of said preliminary investigation, the IDF stated that it was “highly likely” that Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her” during a “violent riot.”Turkish American activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi's mother, Rabia Birden, mourns at her daughter's grave in, Aydin, Turkey, on Sept. 14.

Eygi’s family also called the Israeli probe “wholly inadequate.”The evidence suggests that an Israeli sniper intentionally shot an unarmed Eygi in the head from an elevated position while she was in a quiet olive grove more than 200 yards away from Israeli forces, about 30 minutes after clashes between Palestinian residents and Israeli soldiers subsided and most protesters had retreated.The U.S. must take the evidence into consideration and launch an independent probe into whether Eygi’s killing was a homicide, the lawmakers said.

8889837cb87a1884cedd4361db79a6aa,"— The Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled a willingness to uphold a Biden administration regulation on â€œghost guns,â€� mail-order kits that allow people to build untraceable weons at home and that are turning up at crime scenes with greater frequency. In one of the most closely watched cases of the year, the high court must decide if the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority with a 2022 regulation that would require ghost gun manufacturers to include serial numbers on the kits and perform background checks on people who purchase them. Several of the courtâ€™s conservatives â€” and all of its liberals â€” peared skeptical of the notion that the kits are geared toward a tradition of gunsmithing hobbyists. Chief Justice John Roberts, in particular, brushed off the idea that building the kind of gun kits at issue was equivalent to someone working on a classic car. â€œDrilling a hole or two, I would think, doesnâ€™t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,â€� Roberts said to the lawyer representing the kit manufacturers. â€œMy understanding is that itâ€™s not terribly difficult for someone to do this.â€� Peter Patterson, representing the manufacturers and groups that challenged the regulation, said that building the kits is far more complicated than the administration has suggested. In briefing, supporters of the regulation say that most Americans would view a bicycle as a bicycle, even if its pedals were missing. A build-at-home couch from Ikea, they argue, is still a couch before it is assembled. How to draw the line between a collection of parts and a finished product occupied much of the argument, which lasted over an hour. â€œSome of us who â€¦ donâ€™t have a lot of mechanical ability, have spent hours and hours and hours trying to assemble things that weâ€™ve purchased,â€� Justice Samuel Alito quipped, prompting chuckles in the courtroom. â€œIâ€™m with you on that one, Justice Alito, as someone who struggles with Ikea furniture,â€� quipped US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration. Though not a Second Amendment dispute, the lawsuit put guns back on to the high courtâ€™s docket at a time when its 6-3 conservative majority has tacked to the right on that issue and many others. In June, the conservative justices court struck down a ban on bump stocks, devices that convert semi-automatic rifles into a weons that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute, for instance. But there were signs that some members of the courtâ€™s conservative wing saw this case differently than the one dealing with bump stocks. Even before the parties entered the courtroom Tuesday, the justices had hinted their thoughts on the dispute by siding with the Biden administration â€” twice â€” on the emergency docket. On a 5-4 vote, the court allowed the regulation to remain in place while the litigation continued. Though it doesnâ€™t necessarily reflect the outcome of the case, both Roberts and conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the administration at the time. Alito led the questioning against the government, signaling skepticism over the idea that a collection of unassembled parts can be considered a gun. â€œHereâ€™s a blank pad and hereâ€™s a pen, all right? Is this a grocery list?â€� Alito asked holding up a pad in the courtroom.Â â€œIf I show you â€“ I put out on a counter some eggs, some chopped up ham, some chopped up pepper and onions, is that a western omelet?â€� Prelogar that a pen and pad could be used for any number of things â€“ not just a grocery list â€“ and the ingredients could be used to make other dishes. The difference here, she said, is that the ghost guns are marketed to be built into guns and serve no other conceivable purpose. Barrett jumped in to challenge Alitoâ€™s hypothetical. â€œWould your answer change if you ordered it from HelloFresh and you got a kit and it was like turkey chili, but all of the ingredients are in the kit?â€� she said, referring to the food kit delivery service and describing a context that looks more like how gun kits are sold. Prelogar said that was a more t analogy. â€œIf you bought from Trader Joeâ€™s some omelet-making kit that had all of the ingredients to make the omelet,â€� she said, â€œwe would recognize that for what it is.â€� These DIY gun kits can be purchased without a background check 03:04 - Source: Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh aired a different concern: that the administrationâ€™s regulation would leave some ghost gun sellers unaware that they are breaking the law. â€œThis is an agency regulation that broadens a criminal statute beyond what it had been before,â€� Kavanaugh asked. â€œWhat about the seller, for example, who is truly not aware â€” truly not aware â€” that they are violating the law and gets criminally charged?â€� Prelogar said prosecutors would have to prove that the seller was willfully violating the law. Kavanaugh described Prelogarâ€™s answer as â€œhelpful.â€� Ghost guns are kits that a user can purchase online to assemble a fully functional firearm at home. The weons carry no serial number, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise legally prohibited from buying firearms. President Joe Bidenâ€™s administration told the court in briefing that police departments have faced an â€œexplosion of crimes involving ghost gunsâ€� in recent years. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns recovered at crime scenes for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000. At issue is a 1968 law that requires manufacturers and dealers to run background checks, keep sales records and include serial numbers on firearms. The ATF concluded that the law covers the kits, which the agency said can quickly be built into functioning firearms. The rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of the kits but instead requires serial numbers and background checks. Advocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing that the regulation wasnâ€™t permitted by the law. The kits arenâ€™t weons, they said, but rather parts. A US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision. Importantly, the Supreme Court has weighed into the case twice on its emergency docket, allowing the regulation to remain in place temporarily while the legal wrangling continued. Last year, five justices sided with the Biden administration in the first emergency request. After that decision, a lower court stepped in to block the regulations as plied to two manufacturers. The Supreme Court again rejected that decision, allowing the regulations to remain in effect. A decision in the case, Garland v. VanDerStok, is expected by next summer. with additional details.

8a89b985acf29ce0299f065d02249f30,"Vice President Kamala Harris demonstrated in Tuesday night’s presidential debate, in case any rational person had doubts, that she is the only decent, prepared and fit candidate in the presidential race. In both her answers and demeanor, she demonstrated the unmistakable contrast between a mature, responsible adult and someone who resembles the mean, crazy relative no one wants to sit next to at the holiday table.When ABC News’s debate moderators, Linsey Davis and David Muir, opened the proceedings, she came out swinging, rattling off a list of her domestic proposals. She plainly had her ducks in a row, attacking Donald Trump for the largest trade deficit in history, for selling microchips to China and even for praising Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the coronavirus. Trump was clearly rattled, resorting to lies about everything from his economic record to abortion.Throughout, Harris remained calm and collected, not bothering to rebut every lie, and instead hitting Trump on the main issues — his favoritism toward the rich, his contempt for democracy and his weakness on national security.On abortion, when Trump made his usual infanticide claim about Democrats, moderator Davis debunked it. Harris then hit the answer out of the ballpark, giving a passionate defense of freedom. She demolished his claim that “everybody” wanted abortion law to be determined by the states. Between the moderators and Harris, Trump was put on defense, refusing to say whether he would sign a national abortion ban. Harris stood, amused, urging him to answer the question. He never did. The moderators got Trump to admit that he did not yet have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. (“I have concepts of a plan” will surely be mocked.)Follow Jennifer RubinOn national security, Harris hit him hard for refusing to back Ukraine in the war with Russia: “He would just give [Ukraine] up.” She recounted her meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European allies aiding Ukraine’s “righteous” defense. She warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has “his eyes on the rest of Europe” and dared Trump to tell Polish Americans that he would abandon the fight to curry favor with Putin, “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.” Liz Cheney was right: Harris is the Reaganesque candidate in this contest.Emphasizing the need for unity and decency, she attacked Trump’s race-baiting: “I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people.”Harris was properly aggressive throughout, launching into Trump’s criminal record, his inherited wealth and his weakness on foreign policy, citing his susceptibility to flattery from dictators. Again and again, she raised the number of his former aides who now show disdain for him. (“I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you’re a disgrace.”) Harris utterly flummoxed Trump by mocking his rally rhetoric as bizarre and tedious, noting that his followers leave early. That seemed to set Trump off, as he went on a tirade about having “the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.”When Trump railed about the Biden administration, at one point saying, “She is Biden,” Harris deadpanned, “I am not Joe Biden.”As for the ABC debate moderators, their performance should be graded on three criteria: Did they refuse to treat Trump as a normal candidate? Did they provide as much fact-checking as possible to counter his nonstop lying? Did they help voters understand the basic views of the two candidates? On all three, Davis and Muir did well.To a greater extent than the CNN moderators in Trump’s debate with Biden in June, the moderators confronted Trump with some of his most outlandish lies (e.g., on Democrats’ abortion policies and the 2020 election results). They confronted him with his racist comments about Harris, and their prodding helped reveal his lack of a health-care policy. When Trump repeated his ludicrous claim about undocumented immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating people’s pets, Muir promptly knocked it down.As for the debate offering clarity about the presidential race, it certainly revealed that Harris has a truckload of specific positions and proposals; Trump has grievances, revenge fantasies and blather. If voters cannot figure out which candidate is prepared to be president, blame rests with them, not with the ABC News team.Some pundits before the debate set a flurry of tests that Harris supposedly had to pass: Could she peal to independents, could she pear presidential, could she show mastery of policy details? Harris did all that and more, conveying an optimistic vision that offered a dramatic contrast with Trump’s ocalyptic rhetoric.Disregard any post-debate analysis that says the confrontation won’t matter, won’t change any minds. Harris did superbly Tuesday, and it will make a difference. Fair-minded voters will notice.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/11/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/,washingtonpost,Agree,Agree,5,-5,5.0,-5.0,Agree,Agree,"The article strongly supports the Democrat party by praising Kamala Harris's performance, criticizing Donald Trump, and highlighting Harris's policy proposals and demeanor as superior.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! About a year ago, I signed into law an increase in the minimum wage for fast-food workers. The legislation created new protections for these hard-working people and gave them a greater voice in establishing workplace standards. That bill, which took effect on April 1, increased the minimum wage to $20 per hour for workers at fast-food chains with 60 or more locations and created new health and safety standards.Predictably, this modest law prompted fainting spells from conservatives and their enablers in the media. Even before I signed the bill, they quickly said it would lead to devastating job cuts and cause scores of businesses to close. California Gov. Gavin Newsom greets people, Monday, , near the Common Man Roadside Market and Deli, in Hooksett, New Hampshire. ( Photo/Steven Senne)It was used as a scegoat for businesses declaring bankruptcy, firing workers and more.

It shows that the opposite is hpening: California now has more fast-food jobs than ever.We believe in fairness, equity and the idea that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. And these results dispel the cynics who say we must choose between protecting workers and growing the economy. In fact, fast-food jobs have increased every month this year. Since the law was enacted, California has added 11,000 new jobs in the industry. As of July, our state boasts a historic 750,500 fast-food jobs. Customers can be seen walking outside one of the nation's largest fast-food chains, McDonald's. (Getty s) But the benefits of a higher minimum wage extend well beyond these job numbers. A quarter of fast-food workers are the primary income earners for their families, and two-thirds are women. These workers are more likely than most to deal with workplace retaliation, extreme heat, unsafe working conditions, wage theft and more.Because of California’s compassion for working people, these men and women living paycheck to paycheck now enjoy better working conditions, reduced financial stress and greater opportunities for upward mobility. Families are finding it easier to make ends meet, reducing their reliance on public assistance programs and contributing to a healthier, more prosperous state.US STATES LOOKING TO BOOST MINIMUM WAGE TO $20 AS INFLATION ISSUE CONTINUESThis is an industry that has seen profits soar while wages stagnate. Last year, the top 10 fast food chains saw surging growth, including McDonald's, which had a 63% increase in profits. Also, last year, the 10 biggest fast-food companies spent $6.1 billion on stock buybacks – largely benefiting Wall Street investors.Contrast those profits with the stories of real people working to support themselves and their families.

9a456b673671aca56a33f95666e23862,"When three little girls, Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar, were so callously killed in Southport last week, I – along with the entire country – was sickened and shaken to the core. But there was no time for their families to grieve in peace, or space for the solidarity that arises from a period of national sorrow. Instead, the tragedy was violently hijacked by far-right thugs on the basis of flagrant lies, emerging from a climate of Islamophobia and racist, divisive rhetoric that has always been a threat to us all.Over the past week, my mobile phone has been pinging with messages conveying anxiety and fear from family, friends and colleagues. Clips have been circulating of Muslim businesses torched, ethnic minority members of the public being attacked and chants of “Pakis out” at passersby on the streets.An American Pakistani friend asked whether her family should cancel their flight to London. A friend’s law firm, which represents asylum seekers, was on a list of supposed “targets”. My brother, a GP, decided not to do a home visit in a deprived white area for fear of attack by far-right sympathisers. While others are defiant and refusing disruption to their daily routines, I am bitter and resentful about how many people’s lives now have to be proached with caution, and how safety is now a consideration for everyday, often trivial decisions. All of this because of extremist fearmongering.I have been watching the news incessantly. I can’t switch off because it is all so painfully, exhaustingly personal. When Zarah Sultana, an MP and an Asian Muslim woman like me, was derided, interrupted and gaslit while pointing out the reality of Islamophobia to an all-white panel of hosts on Good Morning Britain this week, it was like our experiences were being undermined. Even the dead couldn’t lie in peace: Muslim graves in Burnley were daubed with paint, and I felt it could have been my own father’s grave that was desecrated. When a black care worker’s car was torched, it was all frighteningly close to home.It’s not as if I, or others like me, haven’t faced instances of racism before. I was first called a “Paki” at the age of five, as a teen told to “go back to your own country”, and as an adult was taunted while riding a London bus by an intoxicated passenger: “You Muslims, I’m going to kill you.” But I could brush these off as isolated, even innocuous, incidents in a largely peaceful life. Through the years, I have learned to scoff at the occasional passive-aggressive look from strangers to remind me of my “otherness”. But nothing has shaken me as much as the levels of violence seen during these terrifying riots; scenes that for many people older than me will trigger unsettling memories of the racist attacks of the 1970s and 80s.Thousands of anti-racism protesters gather across England – videoI am not alone by any means. It’s not only minorities that feel this way: everyone is scared to some degree, everyone feels attacked because, and I cannot stress this enough, far-right extremism is a threat to us all. A threat to our way of life, our peace and safety, and to the thriving diversity that I still believe Britain is the beacon of – despite the divisive forces that seek to destroy it.The fascists have done one constructive thing: an abundance of goodwill and solidarity has come to the fore as different communities have united to defy their racism and thuggery. In Southport, the mess they left brought people on to the streets to clean up after the attack on a mosque; in Liverpool, an imam launched a crowdfunder to help repair the local library and buildings damaged by riots; and people are now willing to unite to fight against racism even more tenaciously.I was moved to tears by the beautiful solidarity on display across the country as thousands of people voiced their unity against hate in large anti-racism demonstrations on Wednesday evening. Gathering to protect their local communities and places rumoured to be targeted by the far right – who were barely to be seen – they held aloft placards that read “Nans Against Nazis”, “Refugees welcome” and “This is what community looks like”. The people of Britain sent a clear and strong message – there is no place for fascism in our country.Such demonstrations are a testament to a resilient community spirit. Yet until we see a marked change in public and political discourse that challenges the insidious rhetoric of division and racism in all its forms, until we see accountability for those inciting hate and spreading lies, and until we address institutional racism, the danger of far-right extremism will not be suppressed. It will continue to drip-feed from the top down and manifest in ugliness on our streets and in our society, negatively affecting all British lives.We each have a role to play: politicians, the media, leaders, philanthropists and all members of local communities have the agency to define the political climate through the power of togetherness, through truth-telling, through investment and the celebration of diversity in every field.How long the scars of this violence will last, and how more organised or underground these extreme groups will become, remains to be seen. But challenging the discourse, and protecting and building a society where everyone feels they belong, is a continual process that we can all lend our hands to.

9dbdf830b633fccefde32c0a9da70fc8,"Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Republican leadership are reportedly discussing attaching a bill that requires proof of citizenship to vote to a stop-g spending bill. The federal government will shut down on September 30 if Congress fails to pass a spending bill, and congressional leaders are eyeing a short-term spending bill that would fund the government past Election Day, November 5. Johnson and Republican leaders are now considering attaching the SAVE Act, a bill that would require proof of citizenship to vote in a federal election, to the short-term spending bill that would continue funding the government until March 2025. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) introduced the legislation and told Breitbart News Daily in June that there is “repeated evidence” of non-citizens voting. “Let me just say this about the overall state of the election issue,” Roy said. “We’ve got repeated evidence of those who are here illegally — or whether they’re here legally — but non-citizens voting.” “Noncitizen voting is a threat to election integrity,” Speaker Johnson said in a policy brief on the bill. Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) said in a statement after the bill passed in July: Voting is a sacred right for American citizens, and illegal immigrants should never have the opportunity to vote in our elections. The Biden Administration has allowed millions of illegal immigrants into our country, and we must ensure illegals cannot register to vote and sway our elections. It tells you everything you need to know that the Biden Administration opposes this commonsense effort and wants to maintain loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to vote while keeping our Southern Border wide open. I will continue fighting to preserve election integrity and prevent illegal immigrants from voting. A 2022 YouGov survey found that 65 percent of Americans back requiring proof of citizenship to vote in elections, which included 48 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of swing voters, and 88 percent of Republicans.

a17ee1fec1fd3b8fbe93174ad90c7eb2,"Washington — As advisers to Vice President Kamala Harris were mulling where to stage the final major address of her campaign, they had a few boxes to check. The venue, they believed, must convey a degree of gravity about the choice before voters. But equally important, in their view, was its ability to evoke the promise of the office she seeks. In the Ellipse â€“ the patch of park where Donald Trump rallied his supporters on , within view of the White House â€“ they believe they found that equilibrium. â€œItâ€™s really a reminder of the gravity of the job, how much a president can do for good and for bad, to she the country and impact peopleâ€™s lives,â€� Jennifer Oâ€™Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, said Tuesday. â€œBut itâ€™s also a stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how heâ€™s used his power for bad, really focusing on himself and spreading division and chaos and inciting a mob to try to maintain his own power and put himself over the country.â€� For Harris, striking a balance between dire warnings about a rival she calls a fascist and forward-looking optimism about the president she would be has become a defining challenge of the campaignâ€™s closing stretch. Tuesdayâ€™s high-profile speech is one of the last remaining opportunities for the vice president to try to reach a critical segment of the electorate known inside the campaign as â€œconflicted voters,â€� aides said, or those who may have concerns with Trumpâ€™s conduct but who are not yet convinced Harris is a candidate of change who can get the country on track. While itâ€™s hard to imagine that one speech could move the needle, aides said, it is also intended to draw a clear contrast with Trumpâ€™s controversial Madison Square Garden rally Sunday evening. That was not the original intent of Harrisâ€™ major address, aides said, but they believe it serves as a timely rebuttal. â€œItâ€™s going to crystallize many of the key arguments that she started with,â€� according to a source familiar with Harrisâ€™ speech, citing reproductive freedom and her framing of what she calls an â€œopportunity economy.â€� Despite the sober overtones of the setting â€“ it is where Trump told his supporters to march to the Citol on January 6; many did, causing destruction and death â€“ Harrisâ€™ advisers say the speech will be hopeful and optimistic, and not focused exclusively on the events that unfolded at the site nearly four years ago. If there is a takeaway from that day she wants to drive home, it is that her own victory would turn the page on Trumpâ€™s divisiveness, according to advisers. With the office she is seeking to occupy 500 yards to the north, the setting provides Harris an opportunity to describe her plans for country, principally on the economy, the top issue for voters. In the final week of the campaign, the speech isnâ€™t intended to cover entirely new ground, aides said, but rather to frame the stakes of the race and highlight the deep contrast between Harris and Trump. Standing on the Ellipse, aides said, will allow Harris toÂ bringÂ familiar arguments about democracyÂ to life in a setting that explicitly highlights the lengths that Trump and his allies went to try to overturn the 2020 election.Â The venue will also underscoreÂ how she believes a second term could be worse, they said. â€œAs Iâ€™ve said many times and Iâ€™ll say tomorrow night in my speech, thereâ€™s a big difference between he and I. If he were elected on Day 1, heâ€™s going to be sitting in the Oval Office working on his enemies list,â€� Harris said Monday. â€œOn Day 1, if Iâ€™m elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.â€� Preparations were underway on Monday ahead of the speech, including the installation of tall black fencing to create a secure perimeter around the Ellipse. An amended permit for the event showed as many as 40,000 people are expected to attend, with spillover onto the National Mall â€“ her first major campaign speech outdoors in Washington. Most of Harrisâ€™ large rallies this year have been in arenas or stadiums in battleground states. The vice president worked on her remarks as she traveled to Michigan on Monday for three campaign stops, aides said, working through final drafts for one of the biggest speeches since the Democratic convention. She also is expected to address the economy, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and her broader middle-class agenda, even though the sharpest contrasts are likely to come on Trumpâ€™s character. In some ways, it harks back to Harrisâ€™ remarks at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, making Tuesdayâ€™s speech something of a bookend in her extraordinarily truncated campaign. â€œAll of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,â€� Harris said at the time. â€œBecause we here know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.â€� Aides have likened Tuesdayâ€™s speech to the closing arguments Harris delivered as a prosecutor early in her career. After laying out evidence for a jury â€” in this case, voters â€” she is hoping to tie the various threads together into a single case for herself. She hasnâ€™t been lacking in advice. As they have been since Biden was the partyâ€™s standard-bearer, Democrats are somewhat divided on how much to emphasize Trumpâ€™s character and perceived danger to democracy versus more narrowly focusing on pocketbook issues. Last week, the leading super PAC supporting Harrisâ€™ candidacy raised concerns that the Harris campaign was too closely centering its closing message on calling Trump a fascist. â€œThis topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harrisâ€™ economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights,â€� the group warned in an email to Democrats about messaging in the final stretch of the campaign. Still, Harrisâ€™ advisers believe there are moderates who will be swayed by the links between Trump and fascism, particularly when raised by his former top aide, John Kelly. More broadly, the Harris team views the closing days of the campaign as a moment to harness widespread exhaustion and frustration at Trumpâ€™s chaotic brand of politics, not only by shining a spotlight on the tumult but also by offering a clear alternative. Since the moment Harris ascended to the top of the ticket in July, her campaign has worked to citalize on the trpings of office â€“ and the power of strong imagery â€“ to help voters see her as presidential and take the historic step of electing the first woman as commander in chief. The sweeping backdrop of the White House and the National Mall was designed for maximum effect a week before the final day of voting. Itâ€™s something of an analogue to an August rally in Detroit, where Harris spoke to thousands before the majestic backdrop of Air Force Two. The prime-time speech on the Ellipse comes amid rising anxiety from some over how much time Harris is devoting to disqualify Trump compared with what she would do if elected. The Tuesday night address, advisers tell CNN, is intended to be a balance of both messages. â€œWe donâ€™t have the luxury of just talking about what she would do as president,â€� a top Democratic adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategic decisions. â€œWe canâ€™t pretend this is an ordinary election.â€�",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/kamala-harris-ellipse-speech/index.html,cnn,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,1,-4,2.0,-4.0,Agree,Disagree,"The article predominantly supports the Democrat party by highlighting Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign strategies and her efforts to contrast her vision with that of Donald Trump.

a3ac91c93ddaae2eec338de95661f26f,"I understand that there are millions of Americans who disagree with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the terrible war in Gaza. I am one of them.While Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of ober 2023, which killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages, it did not have the right to wage an all-out war against the entire Palestinian people.It did not have the right to kill 42,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of whom were children, women and the elderly, or injure over 100,000 people in Gaza. It did not have the right to destroy Gaza’s infrastructure and housing and healthcare systems. It did not have the right to bomb every one of Gaza’s 12 universities. It did not have the right to block humanitarian aid, causing massive malnutrition in children and, in fact, starvation.And that is why I am doing everything I can to block US military aid and offensive weons sales to the rightwing extremist Netanyahu government in Israel. And I know that many of you share those feelings. And some of you are saying, “How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war?” And that is a very fair question.And let me give you my best answer. And that is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his rightwing friends are worse. In the Senate and in Congress Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice-president both support getting as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible.Trump has said that Netanyahu is doing a good job and that Biden is holding him back. He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. It is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office.But even more importantly, and this I promise you, after Harris wins we will, together, do everything we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu – including an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, a surge of massive humanitarian aid, the stopping of settler attacks on the West Bank, and the rebuilding of Gaza for the Palestinian people.And let me be clear. We will have, in my view, a much better chance of changing US policy with Harris than with Trump, who is extremely close to Netanyahu and sees him as a like-minded, rightwing extremist ally.But let me also say this, and I deal with this every single day as a US senator. As important as Gaza is, and as strongly as many of us feel about this issue, it is not the only issue at stake in this election.If Trump wins, women in this country will suffer an enormous setback and lose the ability to control their own bodies. That is not acceptable.If Trump wins, to be honest with you, the struggle against the climate crisis is over. While virtually every scientist who has studied the issue understands that the climate crisis is real and an existential threat to our country and the world, Trump believes it is a “hoax”. And if the United States, the largest economy in the world, stops transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, every other country – China, Europe, all over the world, they will do exactly the same thing. And God only knows the kind of planet we will leave to our kids and future generations.If Trump wins, at a time of enormous income and wealth inequality, he will demand even more tax breaks for the very richest people in our country, while cutting back on programs that working families desperately need. The rich will only get richer, while the minimum wage will remain at $7.25 an hour, and millions of our fellow workers will continue to earn starvation wages.Did you all see the recent Trump rally at Madison Square Garden? Well, I did, and what I can tell you is that as a nation, as all of you know, we have struggled for years against impossible odds to try to overcome all forms of bigotry – whether it is racism, whether it’s sexism, whether it’s homophobia, whether it’s xenophobia, you name it.We have tried to fight against bigotry, but that is exactly what we saw on display at that unbelievable Trump rally. It was not a question of speakers getting up there and disagreeing with Kamala Harris on the issues. That wasn’t the issue at all. They were attacking her simply because she was a woman and a woman of color. Extreme vulgar sexism and racism. Is that really the kind of America that we can allow?So let me conclude by saying this. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Many of you have differences of opinion with Harris on Gaza. So do I. But we cannot sit this election out. Trump has to be defeated. Let’s do everything we can in the next week to make sure that Kamala Harris is our next president. Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and chair of the health education labor and pensions committee.

abedba6c8c2ad5b827373adbbc886299,"Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in four key battleground states, an InsiderAdvantage survey shows. The surveys, each taken September 29-30, examined the race in what it dubbed the “Sunbelt States” — Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia. In Arizona, Trump sees a one-point advantage, leading Harris with 49 percent support to her 48 percent support. Another two percent are undecided, and one percent said “other.” That lead, of course, is within the survey’s +/- 3 percent margin of error. In Nevada, Trump also sees a one-point advantage, leading Harris with 49 percent support to Harris’s 48 percent support. Once again, that lead is within the survey’s +/- 3.52 percent margin of error. Like Arizona, two percent remain undecided in Nevada, and one percent said “other.” While Trump garnered 50 percent support in North Carolina, once again, just one point separates him from Harris, who sees 49 percent support — well within the survey’s +/- 3.7 percent margin of error. The race is even tighter in Georgia, where Trump and Harris are tied with 48 percent support each. Another three percent remain undecided, and one percent said “other.” InsiderAdvantage Pollster Matt Towery said in a statement that there are signs of Trump “gaining momentum in each of the states we surveyed where he led and potentially even in Georgia, where the race is tied.” “Our surveys contain only the horserace and demogrhics, but we added a question following a response to the horserace which asks respondents how they believe ‘the majority’ of their neighbors will vote,” he said, explaining that it has become a reliable marker in measuring other races. “In each state the response to ‘the neighbors’ question expanded Trump’s lead well beyond the margin of error,” he noted, emphasizing that these are still tight races. The survey comes as the race enters its final month and Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) gears up for a debate against Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). It also comes as Harris faces scrutiny for her response — or lack thereof — to Hurricane Helene, which has destroyed areas inland including in Georgia and North Carolina.

ae0b013ab40c03d3a1057164a6ffcc7d,"SKIP ADVERTISEMENTPamela Paul...Illustration by Sam Whitney/A lot of people have been wondering what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can possibly be thinking, and I can say with confidence that no one is better positioned to offer an answer than I am.Yes, I am the worm.Until now I’ve kept a low profile. But the false and vicious rumors about my supposed demise and Kennedy’s ungracious threat to invite more brain worms into what is clearly occupied territory have forced me to speak out. It is true, as Kennedy has indicated, that I ate a portion of his brain, but that is perfectly normal parasitic behavior. And despite what his doctor might have told him, I am alive and thriving and ready to let my feelings be known.I know what you’re thinking. Since I ate part of the brain and live within it, I must be just a shill for Kennedy, somehow complicit in his political ambitions. Implicit in all the gossip about me was that I somehow contributed to Kennedy’s erratic behavior and outlandish beliefs.Sure, blame the worm.I can’t say I was surprised by the vitriol directed at me on social media, the scegoating and targeting. It’s always the most vulnerable who are subjected to the most outrageous and self-righteous attacks.These allegations couldn’t be further from the truth. The portions of Kennedy’s brain that I ate were entirely related to his early environmental activism. I ate the entire Riverkeeper archives and took particular care to include that hullabaloo over his hiring of a rare bird egg smuggler and tax evader to help the group monitor New York City’s compliance with certain environmental standards.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shing the world every weekday morning. “I am just palled,” Robert Boyle, Riverkeeper’s former president and founder, told The Times. “It was imprudent, reckless and irresponsible of Bobby to hire him. And he didn’t have the right. I do the hiring and firing.”You probably don’t remember any of this, and Bobby can’t, because I swallowed the entire episode whole. I’ve consumed many of Kennedy’s formative inconsistencies, including his harebrained scheme (yes, that’s a worm’s version of ironic wordplay) to sell a new line of bottled water, which tasted to me like a strange project for an environmental activist. Even with a fancy label created by a designer from Tiffany’s, Keeper Springs Mountain Spring Water wasn’t going to gain traction against Evian. Anyway, he doesn’t have to think about that whole thing anymore.Frankly, I stayed away from all that vaccine nonsense. I found that hard to swallow. Even a worm has standards. And implying that Covid was designed to spare Ashkenazi Jews and the Chinese? That’s just distasteful.But all this is old news. What’s eating at people’s heads now is Kennedy’s endorsement of Donald Trump for president. The truth is, like a lot of New Yorkers, Kennedy and Trump go way back. Although Kennedy has no recollection of the part I ate about their mutual friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, as they cavorted among the city’s power elites.Here’s what a worm remembers: Back in 1997, the two were on the same side in a strange bedfellows bid to defeat legalized casino gambling in New York. Kennedy, because development would harm ecological havens in the Adirondacks and the Catskills; Trump, because it would divert money that might otherwise be spent at his Atlantic City casinos. They won, and we know Trump likes to remember his rare successes.Then, in early 2017, the two vaccine skeptics met in New York as part of Trump’s transition planning. According to a still intact part of Bobby’s brain, Trump asked him to lead what was described as a commission dedicated to “vaccine safety and scientific integrity.” Well, my guy never heard back from Trump to follow up on this plan, and that did not make him hpy at all. He couldn’t get over it. How could a guy like Trump offer a Kennedy a job and then never follow up?Yeah, so that may have bred the resentment I can sense deep in his amygdala. When Kennedy had to declare his candidacy, he raged against Trump’s pandemic lockdowns, a betrayal of what he took to be core shared values. Trump shot back, calling Kennedy “one of the most Liberal Lunatics ever to run for office” on Truth Social, adding, “A Phony Radical Left fool whose poll numbers are TERRIBLE, and getting worse.”That one really stuck in his craw. “But I’m nonpartisan,” he’d mutter in his sleep. “And that’s rare for a Kennedy.”So how did these two wind up all copacetic? If there’s one thing Kennedy and Trump share beyond an indifference to science and a taste for conspiracy theory, it’s an almost puckish refusal of consistency. Through my own lived experience, I know that Kennedy remembers only what he chooses to remember. Let bygones be bygones! Trump declared Kennedy was “beloved.” Kennedy said he was “choosing to believe” that this time, Trump really would give him that cushy health care job.I haven’t a clue what’s banging around in Trump’s head, but I can say this: From what I’ve seen in this here brain, you can believe what you want to believe.Pamela Paul is an Opinion columnist at The Times, writing about culture, politics, ideas and the way we live now.

Deceptive tactics have misled hundreds of elderly Americans â€” many battling dementia or other cognitive impairments â€” into giving away millions of dollars to political fundraising campaigns, ainvestigation has revealed. The desperate pleas for donations frequently come as text messages and emails delivered at an unrelenting pace, directing these vulnerable individuals to pages that often sign them up for monthly â€” or even weekly â€” donations. Money is then drained from their bank accounts without them realizing it. Contributions from a small sampling of 50 unwitting elderly donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years â€” the majority of which ended up with former President Donald Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates,found. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on a high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East as the US seeks to move forward with long-stalled negotiations to bring back the Israeli hostages and end the war in Gaza. In the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, there pears to be little clarity on who will take over the militant group, making it difficult to ascertain the probability of striking a new deal. Hamas has shown no inclination to change its stance on hostage and ceasefire negotiations. Blinken is expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today amid tempered expectations he will return to Washington having made any significant progress on the hostage talks. Instead, US officials believe that the most pivotal place for him to make progress is on the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza. Former President Donald Trump repeated debunked claims about the federal response to Hurricane Helene during his visit to North Carolina on Monday. Speaking to reporters in a hard-hit community near Asheville, Trump made the false assertion that FEMA took money that was supposed to go to disaster relief and instead spent it on migrants who entered the country illegally, leaving the agency with no funds to help Americans. Trump claimed that FEMAâ€™s money is â€œall goneâ€� â€” which is false. As of last Tuesday, its Disaster Relief Fund had about $8.5 billion remaining, FEMA told CNN. The agency has made clear that it has enough money for the immediate needs of people affected by Hurricane Helene â€” though the large number of disasters around the country this year means the agency might have to ask Congress for additional disaster relief funding sooner than expected. Allergy season is starting earlier and lasting longer, which scientists attribute to a variety of causes, including the climate crisis. As temperatures stay warmer into the fall, plants that release allergens have more time to grow. Whatâ€™s more, higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel use and emissions further drive plant growth, generating more pollen. The most common culprit for fall allergies is a plant called ragweed, the CDC says, which can release 1 billion grains of pollen per plant. Pollen exposure can trigger various allergic reactions, including symptoms of hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis. These symptoms vary seasonally or year-round, affecting up to 60 million people annually in the US, according to the CDC. What are your questions about fall allergies?

c6762532774c1ea8d609bfa6ed4c2d84,"SKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘Nothing Left to Lose’: Why Are Britain’s Conservatives So Upbeat?At its annual convention in Birmingham, the party is energized by a leadership contest and seems largely undisturbed by broader questions over its electability.Banners promoting the four leadership candidates at the Conservative Party’s annual conference in Birmingham, where the mood was cheerful. “I was expecting something a little more gloomy, seeing as we had been defeated,” one party member said. “It’s really positive, it’s buzzing.”...Henry Nicholls/ — Getty sOct. 2, 2024Updated ETBritain’s Conservative Party suffered the worst election defeat of its modern history less than three months ago. Yet one would be hard pressed to find much evidence of it at the party’s annual conference in Birmingham, where the drinks flowed, conversation crackled and the mood could be only described as light.Unburdened by government, energized by a lively leadership contest and gleeful at the bumpy debut of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, the Conservatives gathered to plot their future, with some members expressing relief rather than frustration at being thrust into the opposition.“I was expecting something a little more gloomy, seeing as we had been defeated,” said James Paterson, a party member from Hinckley, in the East Midlands. Instead, he said: “It’s really positive, it’s buzzing. The way the Labour Party have made such a mess of their first few months is making it easier.”The upbeat atmosphere was a stark contrast to Labour’s conference last week, which was clouded by anxiety over news media reports about freebies accepted by Mr. Starmer and other senior Labour politicians, as well as the general weight of running the country after being out of government for 14 years.Now taking their turn in opposition, the Conservatives are focusing on electing a new leader. The four remaining candidates — Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Tom Tugendhat — ran a beauty-contest-style gauntlet, giving interviews, grinning for selfies, lobbying lawmakers and even hawking branded merchandise from their own booths.Tom Tugendhat, a former soldier and one of two centrist candidates for the leadership, greeting his supporters....Henry Nicholls/ — Getty sMr. Tugendhat took an early lead in the swag arms race, offering lollipops with his face on them, temporary tattoos and fake tanning spray, “Tugend-tan” (stocks quickly ran out). At Mr. Cleverly’s booth, visitors could spin a wheel of fortune to see what merchandise they would win: Prizes included Taylor Swift-style friendship beads and leakproof water bottles.Ms. Badenoch, a combative former cabinet minister who is popular with the party’s right, stuck to more standard fare, like buttons and lanyards. Another darling of the right, Robert Jenrick, peddled blue-and-white baseball cs emblazoned with the slogan, “We want Bobby J.”Each candidate submitted to questioning by a journalist from the right-wing news channel, GB News, which gave a glimpse into the kinds of issues that motivate Tory Party members, if not the country at large. They all pledged to reduce immigration, and three of them said they would consider pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, a treaty Britain signed 73 years ago, if it raised hurdles to Britain’s efforts to tighten its borders.Still, none of the contenders peared to offer a convincing answer to the existential question confronting the Tories. How can they win back votes they lost on their right flank to Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration party, Reform U.K., without alienating the voters who switched to the centrist Liberal Democrats, who won 72 seats, mainly in areas traditionally dominated by the Conservatives?Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics, said that there was a sense of “nothing left to lose” at the meeting, but that it showed a party “totally failing to think about the failures that lost them office.”Robert Jenrick and his wife, Michal Berkner, playing with slot cars on an exhibition stand. Mr. Jenrick, a front-runner for the leadership, mixes a mild manner with hard-line, right-wing positions....Henry Nicholls/ — Getty sTory members of Parliament will vote next week to winnow the field to two finalists, and a winner will be chosen by members on Nov. 2. Given that the party’s estimated 170,000 members tend to be older, less ethnically diverse and richer than the general population, the candidates’ pitches tilted to the right — sometimes jarringly so.In a promotional video, Mr. Jenrick claimed, without evidence, that British special forces troops “are killing rather than cturing terrorists” because a European human rights court would otherwise force the government to release them. He came under sharp criticism from Mr. Tugendhat and Mr. Cleverly, both former soldiers.Ms. Badenoch got into hot water after declaring in an interview that Britain’s maternity leave payments were “excessive” and that people needed to exercise “more personal responsibility.” She spent much of Monday claiming she had been misrepresented, citing Margaret Thatcher as a fellow victim of the media, and later posted on social media, “of course I believe in maternity pay!”In its unpredictability, the contest has revived memories of 2005, when, after yet another election defeat to Tony Blair, the Conservatives seemed on course to pick a former minister, David Davis, as leader. But then a youthful David Cameron spoke without notes to party activists, impressing them with his energy and seizing the initiative in the race, which he went on to win.This time, according to Robert Hayward, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and an opinion polling expert, the contest is “wide open.”“Party members seem unsure what they want, and there is no stellar candidate in the way that David Cameron was in 2005,” he said.Kemi Badenoch, a combative former cabinet minister who is popular with the party’s right, speaking to reporters....Henry Nicholls/ — Getty sConservative lawmakers have a reputation for skulduggery in leadership contests, and the meeting hummed with suggestions that some of the candidates may have lent their supporters’ votes to one contender in earlier rounds to try to disadvantage another they consider more of a threat.Mr. Hayward said the number of centrist lawmakers was probably not large enough for both Mr. Cleverly and Mr. Tugendhat, the two more middle-of-the-road candidates, to make it to the final round.Mr. Jenrick, who has emerged as perhs the front-runner, mixes a mild manner with hard-line positions. He has argued, for example, that the police should immediately arrest pro-Palestinian demonstrators who shout “Allahu akbar,” an Arabic phrase meaning “God is great.”Moni Kaur Nanda, who ran in the general election but lost to a Labour candidate in the district of Slough, west of London, said she wanted “anybody but Jenrick.” As someone of Indian heritage, she said: “I don’t like the language he is projecting. I don’t think it’s helpful in this country.”James Cleverly, a more centrist leadership candidate, taking a selfie with his wife, Susannah, and his supporters....Toby Melville/Mr. Jenrick did strike a more diplomatic tone on another issue: After declaring previously that he hoped Donald J. Trump would win the American presidential election, the Tory candidate now demurs from an explicit endorsement, saying he would work well with Vice President Kamala Harris if she were the winner.Andrew Williams, a party member and Conservative councilor in Dacorum, Hertfordshire, was won over by Mr. Cleverly’s performance on Tuesday. “If he makes the final two, he will be my choice,” Mr. Williams said. “I felt he was more genuine and can deliver on taking the party forward with unity.”Referring to the scandal-scarred but still popular former prime minister, Boris Johnson, Mr. Williams added, “We don’t have another Boris on offer, but we need someone who can unite the party and peal to the electorate.”Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

d016862d92131277b0a84ba4f07a4d8b,"The New York Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit filed by Mayor Eric Adams attempting to block Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s migrant busing program. The ruling allows the State of Texas to continue busing migrants to New York City. In a post on social media, Governor Abbott vowed to continue busing migrants from the Texas border region to New York City and other sanctuary cities. The ruling by the New York Supreme Court is the second legal victory for Abbott in as many days. Another WIN! The New York Supreme Court REJECTED Mayor Adams’ attempt to block Texas from busing migrants to his sanctuary city. Until the Biden-Harris Administration secures the border, Texas will continue to send migrants to sanctuary cities. https://t.co/8kfMeaJXWe — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) A lawsuit filed by Mayor Adams and the New York Civil Liberties Union accused the bus companies contracted by the Texas Division of Emergency Management of violating the State’s Social Services Law by dropping off migrants “without providing a means of support,” CBS News reported. The New York Supreme Court rejected the city’s request for an injunction. The lawsuit also asked for $700 million to compensate the city for the costs of shelter, food, and health care, the article states. According to the Office of the Texas Governor, Texas has bussed nearly 46,000 migrants to New York City since August of 2022. LAW360 reported: The Commissioner for the New York City Department of Social Services had asked the court to enforce against eight companies Section 149 of the New York Social Services Law, which states that anyone who knowingly brings an out-of-state “needy person” into New York for the purpose of making them a public charge should be obligated to bring them out of New York or monetarily support them. However, New York Supreme Court Justice Mary V. Rosado ruled Monday that the nation’s high court ruled in Edwards v. California that a similar California law was unconstitutional because the transportation of indigent persons from state to state fell within Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce. “The mass migration of people within the country, which the commissioner seeks to chill or prevent, is an issue reserved by the Constitution for Congress, lest the United States fall to a regime of Balkanization with each state setting fort a patchwork of inconsistent criteria for crossing state lines,” Judge Rosado wrote in the order. The New York case is The Commissioner of the New York City Department of Social Services v. Buckeye Coach LLC et al., case number 150122/2024, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, LAW360 reported. This is the second court victory in as many days for Governor Abbott. On Tuesday, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Texas can keep the buoys Governor Greg Abbott ordered installed in the Rio Grande, Breitbart Texas reported. “Biden tried to remove them. I fought to keep them in the water,” Abbott posted on social media. “That is exactly where they will stay.” The Federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit just ruled that Texas can KEEP these buoys in the water securing our border. Biden tried to remove them. I fought to keep them in the water. That is exactly where they will stay. JUSTICE!!!! https://t.co/IlzttmnOVr — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) Following an en banc peal, the court’s majority opinion overturned a lower court’s preliminary injunction and wrote, “We hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that the United States will likely prove that the barrier is in a navigable stretch of the Rio Grande. We cannot square the district court’s findings and conclusions with over a century’s worth of precedent.” The full court’s ruling also overturned an earlier ruling by the three-judge panel, which initially upheld the lower court’s ruling. The case now goes back to the lower court in the Western District of Texas, where a trial on the matter is planned for August 6 in Austin, Texas. The case is USA v.

Former President Donald Trump shared the song on his official Instagram account. “This is now the Number One song, across all charts, about me. Such an unexpected honor.” “The whole project from its inception was intended to portray President Trump in the light that millions of Americans see him in, as oppose to the fog of the gaslighting left machine that wants so badly to identify him as a threat to democracy,” Kahn told Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matt Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday. “President Trump is not a threat to democracy,” Kahn continued. “He’s a threat to the left’s mission to change America into something that’s unrecognizable.” The singer-songwriter went on to say: “I think part of the reason that it’s moving people is that it’s frustrating to watch the Democrat media complex throw these message out and people are going, ‘that’s not who he is. That’s not how I feel about him.'” In addition to dominating iTunes, “Fighter” has garnered more than 10 million views across social media through its music video.

dffb5ff2fe223b24c88707fb27e4992f,"CHATEAUROUX, France () — Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec has gone viral on social media for his seemingly casual attitude while shooting his way to a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics.The most-shared images show Dikec shooting in a T-shirt with one hand in his pocket, a seemingly standard pair of glasses and an impassive look on his face. He’s been likened to a regular guy competing at the Olympics, or even a hitman.The 51-year-old is no newcomer, though. He’s competed at every Summer Olympics since 2008.Some memes contrast Dikec with his Serbian opponent Damir Mikec, who was wearing a blinder over one eye, a lens over the other and a large pair of ear defenders.Did Dikec win a medal?He did, and it made history. Dikec and Sevval Ilayda Tarhan won the silver medal in mixed team 10-meter air pistol shooting Tuesday. It was Turkey’s first-ever medal in Olympic shooting. Mikec and Zorana Arunovic won gold for Serbia. The bronze went to India’s Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh.Unlike Dikec, his teammate Tarhan was competing with large ear defenders and a visor, as well as braids in the red and white colors of the Turkish flag. She was shooting with one hand in her pocket, too. Dikec was 13th in his individual event and is now done at the Paris Olympics. He’s looking ahead to the next Games in 2028, though. “I hope next in Los Angeles (for) a gold medal,” he said Tuesday.What does he think about going viral?Dikec seems to be embracing the trend, reposting a video compilation of Turkish-language memes about him to his Instagram page. The shooting events were held around three hours’ drive south of Paris. Dikec and Tarhan made the journey to the French cital Wednesday, where they were greeted with cheers at the Champions Park, an open-air venue where medalists celebrate with fans.Why didn’t Dikec wear more gear?Shooters have some freedom about how they dress for competition.

Many shooters at the Olympic range in Chateauroux, central France, choose to wear visors to reduce the glare of the lights or so-called blinders over one eye to get a better focus for the eye which is looking down the sights. It’s not quite true that Dikec wasn’t wearing any shooting gear. He had yellow earplugs to block out distractions while he shot in the final. They just weren’t visible from the angle of the image which went viral. Just like Dikec, Chinese rifle shooter Liu Yukun won a gold medal Thursday wearing earplugs but no blinder or visor.Have other shooters gone viral at the 2024 Olympics?Yes, South Korean pistol shooter Kim Yeji’s confident demeanor and dramatic stance have brought praise on social media for her “main character energy”.“The Olympic #shootingsport stars we didn’t know we needed,” the official Olympics account on X posted Thursday with pictures of Kim and Dikec.Kim won silver in the women’s 10-meter air pistol event Sunday behind her South Korean teammate Oh Ye Jin. Kim and Oh are roommates and Kim said she was pleased Oh got the gold because she sees her like a “youngest sibling”.Kim is set to compete again Friday in qualification for the women’s 25-meter pistol event.___ Summer Olympics: https://news.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-yusuf-dikec-turkish-shooter-a7890124304080a48e7ee4294004d306,apnews,Agree,Agree,4,0,4.0,0.0,Agree,Agree,"The article focuses on the achievements and viral moments of Olympic shooters without delving into any political viewpoints, politicians, or policies.

e52c37b8da20aa85046b5b6fe79f04bb,"Viewing the off-off-Broadway musical otherwise known as the Democratic National Convention was a stroll along Memory Lane. From the early wheelchair entrance of the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Barack and Michelle Obama to Oprah, as well as Hillary and Bill Clinton, not to mention Stevie Wonder, I felt as though I was attending an endless awards ceremony for best supporting actor and actress nominees.It helped considerably that musical performances not only punctuated the big acts but also accompanied the introduction of each state delegation. Wardrobe and makeup were off the charts. Direction and production were Hollywood-caliber thanks to the input of Steven Spielberg, among others.It was, in the words of entertainment kingmaker Ed Sullivan, “a really big show.” The production was also smart, cohesive and rewarding in a literary sense. Great stories give readers (or viewers) a narrative that seizes the imagination and creates characters who make us care, that offers reasons for empathy (Joe Biden) or revulsion (Donald Trump), and, in this case, that creates tension between good and evil, love and hate, inclusion and division.The theme throughout the convention was that character counts. If only Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can muster the votes they need to defeat the archenemy of America’s promise — not Trump the dark, brooding ctain of authoritarian chaos but Trump the small, petty, childish peddler of nonsense. What a silly man, the speakers said in so many ways. Former president Obama invoked Trump’s “weird obsession with crowd sizes” with the slightest intimation of a physical parallel.Follow Kathleen ParkerSmallness was always the smart way to characterize Trump. He is, indeed, dangerous to democracy, as the world witnessed on Jan. 6, 2021, during the shocking assault on the U.S. Citol. No one should forget that Trump wanted to overthrow the 2020 election and usurp power from the legitimately elected Joe Biden. This alone should be enough to disqualify him from holding the highest office, never mind a slew of criminal convictions. Without the peaceful transfer of power, our democratic republic risks becoming just another banana republic.As Oprah said, now is a time for grown-up conversation — and (say it with me now) joy! Enter Kamala and Tim, surely the hpiest presidential ticket in recent American history. The president from Hope (Ark.) said it was time to make Harris the president of Joy. If a thousand-watt smile can be equated to joy, then Harris has no rival. Even Obama kept his smiles to a minimum, perhs to avoid comparison.Walz, a former football coach, enters rallies with arms raised as though he has just scored a touchdown. Speaking to the crowd Wednesday night, he came across as a coach and teacher but, more importantly, a father figure — the sort that millions of American children are growing up without. The percentage of children growing up in a single-parent (mostly single-mother) household has doubled since 1968, according to the Census Bureau. For instance, back then about 7.6 million children (11 percent) lived with their mother only, compared with 15.3 million (21 percent) in 2020.Though such figures weren’t mentioned during the convention, several references were made to mothers as the guiding force behind the success and drive of Harris, Michelle Obama and Oprah, among others. The glaring omission of fathers in the Democratic narrative, including Harris’s very-much-alive father, was filled by Walz, advanced in no small part by his tearful son Gus’s injection of pathos into a drama that was at times too much about Trump.Michelle Obama once famously said, “When they go low, we go high.” She decided to try out low for a change in a performance that was vicariously gratifying as she unloaded on Trump. It was as though she finally was free to air her archived grievances and unologetically highlight the racist content of Trump’s attacks on the couple.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who hpen to be Black. Wait, I want to know: Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?”Obama is no Lady Macbeth. Her conscience and her hands are clean. For her spectacular soliloquy, she takes home the Oscar for best supporting actress, though I suspect many in the audience were wondering why she was not leading the ticket. (For that matter, I’ve always wondered why Oprah hasn’t received the Nobel Peace Prize for her revolutionary accomplishments in race relations. Through her decades-long television talk show, she more than anyone brought Black and White America, especially women, together in recognition of their common bonds. There’s still time.)Amid a cast of so many superstars, Harris’s pearance Thursday night had the potential for anticlimax, but the crowd was so inspired and “en fuego” that by then an explosion of hysteria was more likely. She was strong, forceful, compelling and mercifully brief.Regardless of one’s politics, and no matter the (massive) policy differences between the two parties, Democrats delivered a welcome reprieve from the scowling Republican leader and the joyless bunch who gathered last month in Milwaukee. But once the euphoria subsides and the reality of a liberal agenda sets in, voters will begin to assess their options beyond the optics. Much of what the Harris-Walz ticket promises — price controls, $5 trillion in tax increases over the next decade — is far beyond the mainstream, notwithstanding the reasonable-sounding presentations of Democratic presidents past.The truth is, a Democratic victory would be the best outcome for the country. We need two healthy political parties, and the GOP is sick. The only means of recovery is purging the party of Trump and reorganizing around common-sense values. If Trump wins, he’ll likely be the last “Republican” president for a generation.This prospect might peal to some Americans, but balance is essential to the health of organisms and ecosystems, including people and politics. It seems for now that only Democrats — and probably most independents — get this fundamental law of nature. Harris might not have been Democrats’ first pick, but she’s the star of their show now.And no matter how many times the crowd shouted, “Thank you, Joe,” he knows — and you know — that his final bow was the result of ruthless editing by the scriptwriters. It was a really big show, all right.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/23/chicago-dnc-obama-clinton-harris-walz,washingtonpost,Agree,Agree,3,-5,5.0,-5.0,Agree,Disagree,"The article supports the Democrat party by praising the Democratic National Convention, highlighting the positive attributes of Democratic figures like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and Michelle Obama, and criticizing Donald Trump and the Republican party.

Chris Jones, NGA's chief government relations officer and counsel, previously told FOX Business that pricing from suppliers is one of the biggest issues the group’s members face in competing with larger rivals.However, when asked about her economic plans last week by Fox News’ Bret Baier, Harris did not mention her price-gouging proposal.""My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody's and recently The Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy,"" Harris said on ""Special Report."" ""[Trump's] would make them weaker, would ignite inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year.

f8755fbd92cae83dee81437552971d97,"Than Htun, 29, was still in bed when the men came to his home in Yangon to take him away. “He couldn’t prepare anything. They just ordered him to bring his national identity card, a copy of his census registration and two sets of clothes,” recalled his sister, Khin May.The group of soldiers and local officials were forcibly conscripting Than Htun into Myanmar’s military. He would be made to fight for the country’s widely loathed junta in its fierce war against pro-democracy fighters and ethnic armed groups.The Myanmar junta implemented a mandatory conscription law for the first time this year, a move that has evoked terror across the country.Those with the means to do so fled immediately, selling everything they owned and taking on debt to fund their esce. Queues stretched for hours outside embassies and many travelled to areas of the country under the control of opposition groups.People who remain in military-controlled cities such as Yangon live with a constant sense of fear, paying bribes to local officials to avoid being drafted.Soldiers patrol a street in Yangon during a protest in February 2024 on the third anniversary of the coup. Photogrh: AFP/Getty sFamilies from across the country have told the Observer of how their loved ones have been snatched from their homes and forced to enlist, or taken from the streets by soldiers.Since April, when the military began the actual process of conscription, which it made mandatory in February for men aged 18-35, it is believed 25,000 have been taken away to training camps and that 5,000 of these men have been deployed to the frontlines.For the military, facing a severe shortage of manpower after a stream of humiliating defeats and defections, the conscription law could be critical to its survival. More than three years after it seized power in a coup, ousting the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, it is unable to halt armed groups opposing its rule and losing control of vast areas along the borders.“The military is losing continuously,” said Morgan Michaels, research fellow for south-east Asian politics and foreign policy, at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Those losses, if they continue at that level, that’s not sustainable.”Military defeats have escalated since October last year, when a coalition known as the Brotherhood Alliance launched a surprise offensive in northern Shan state. The military was already struggling to control anti-junta groups – called people’s defence forces – that had been formed by civilians after the coup to oppose the dictatorship, often with support from some of the more established ethnic armed factions that have long fought for greater independence.The entry of the Brotherhood Alliance into the conflict stretched the military even further. Over the months that followed, thousands of military personnel, including entire battalions, were reported to have surrendered.Little is known about the training conscripts will be given. Many fear they will be used as cannon fodder or porters – in effect, human shields sent out to clear mines or shield soldiers from gunfire.The soldiers reassured Than Htun’s family, telling them he would be sent for training and then returned to Yangon to work as a security guard. “For us, it was such a relief to hear that,” said Khin May.But it wasn’t true. Instead, he was sent to Rakhine state on the western border, the centre of some of the worst fighting, where the military is desperately trying to hold back the Arakan Army, a member of the Brotherhood Alliance.Than Htun would call his family whenever he could get a phone signal. His sister remembers every conversation. At first, he was assigned as a security guard in a downtown area of the state cital, Sittwe. Then, he told them, he was required to board a ship to Maungdaw in the north of Rakhine, though a fierce storm left them stranded in the middle of the sea, preventing them from continuing. “Food had run out and they were forced to drink rainwater,” she said.Border guards from Myanmar cross into Bangladesh to esce the armed conflict in February 2024. Photogrh: NurPhoto/Getty sOthers faced a worse fate; many soldiers were wounded after one of the military’s naval vessels was attacked by a drone. Than Htun told her of how his unit was sent to rescue them.At the end of July, Than Htun called again one evening to say he had to take a speedboat to Maungdaw. “It was the last phone call he made to us. We haven’t been able to contact him since then,” she said.The military has said it aims to conscript up to 60,000 people by the end of the year, with regime-controlled media saying this will help the junta eliminate its opponents, whom it considers to be terrorists seeking to destabilise the country.In a statement on Thursday, the military said it invited “terrorist” groups to stop fighting and solve problems politically through elections – an unprecedented offer that is likely intended to show its ally China that it is committed to stability. Among the public, it was widely viewed as delusional and disingenuous. Hours later, the military carried out airstrikes in northern Shan state. Groups aligned with the pro-democracy movement want a complete removal of the military from politics – something the junta is unlikely to accept.after newsletter promotionDemonstrators lie on the ground after police open fire to disperse an anti-coup protest in Mandalay, Myanmar, in March 2021. Photogrh:Than Htun was among the hundred of thousands who took to the streets to call for the return of democracy after the military seized power on ruary 2021. The armed forces responded to their peaceful protests by opening fire and detaining, or even torturing and killing, anyone suspected of opposing junta rule, prompting people to take up arms.The ensuing conflict has turned the country upside down. Basic services such as healthcare have collsed, millions are displaced and poverty rates have soared. According to the UN, nearly half the population was living below the national poverty line of 1,590 kyats (about 50p) a day by the end of 2023, up from 24.8% in 2017.Mandatory conscription, which has driven away young people, has only worsened economic hardship.Saw John was another young man snatched from his home. He delivered food by bicycle for a living and was the only breadwinner in the home he shared with his elderly parents. He was taken to a police station for refusing conscription, then to an interrogation centre and later to a training camp in Shan state.His parents were promised support, but it never came. Unable to pay rent, they were kicked out by their landlord.Saw John’s mother died at the end of August. “What I think is that she died of mental anguish after losing contact with her son,” said her close friend Win Khaing. “After their son was arrested, they hardly talked to each other. I had to keep watching them at night, for a month, because I was worried that they might attempt suicide.”Win Khaing felt outraged, he said. “But I can’t do anything because I am only human. I cannot protect myself from guns. I don’t want to be tortured by the soldiers.”In the early days of conscription, some would agree to be drafted in exchange for financial incentives raised by others in their ward.Reports suggest far fewer people are now willing to do this – and that the military has in turn resorted to greater numbers of arrests.Among these was the 27-year-old brother of Thidar, who was returning from work on a peanut field last month when he and other labourers were arrested. Just two days later, they were sent to Taunggyi in Shan state.“Now we are scared even of going to the forest near our village,” Thidar said. The whole village was distraught. “Not only my younger brother and nephew but also all other conscripts are my cousins and relatives. My nephew has a wife who is pregnant,” she added.If they are to fight, she would rather they were doing so for the anti-junta resistance. “We do not have freedom any more.

She has diabetes and hypertension, and her condition has worsened since he was taken in April.

f9f2328ba724f90105d8dbefe05222dd,"Kids notice differences just as readily as adults do. But they haven’t developed a filter to understand when social norms call for them to keep their observations and questions to themselves. If they see a person whose body looks different from theirs, they’re liable to ask — potentially in a loud voice, in a public place — “What hpened to his legs?” or “Why is her arm missing?” It’s important to talk to kids about disability and all the different ways that people’s bodies pear and function, yet this isn’t a conversation that many parents feel prepared to have, having been raised in a society where they learned to keep such questions to themselves. The Paralympics offers parents and caregivers a unique opportunity to talk to kids about disabilities in a positive light, highlighting the athletes’ incredible accomplishments. It also gives you a chance to broach the topic in the comfort of your own home, without the added stress of knowing that strangers are listening in on your response. HuffPost spoke with advocates for people who have limb differences about how parents can best answer kids’ questions. Don’t shut down the conversation.It does not help people with disabilities for you to tell your child to be quiet or that it is impolite to ask questions when they raise the topic. “Discussing disability leads to normalizing disability, which leads to better understanding the needs of diverse communities,” Shree Thaker, director of communications and partnerships for the Amputee Coalition, told HuffPost. The more cognizant kids are of others’ needs, the more likely they are to help create accessible spaces in the future. It’s important not to tell kids, “Don’t look,” or “Don’t ask questions,” Cameron Lutges, a mentor with the No Limits Foundation, told HuffPost.“The only reason kids stare or point is because they’re curious, and being able to allow those kids to be curious and ask those questions allows their brain to grow with the understanding of what limb differences and prosthetics are,” he said.When kids ask specifically about limb loss and limb difference, you might say that “Sometimes athletes who are in the Paralympics are born that way, while others have an accident or illness. Some have visual impairments, as well, and use assistance from people or other senses to adt for their sports,” Cameron Johnson, a physical therist at the No Limits Foundation, suggested.There’s no need to get into specifics if you aren’t aware of a particular athlete’s story. As with any elite athlete, the person’s biogrhical information is likely accessible online if your child wants to learn more about them.Explain that prosthetics are aids, like many other kinds of aids people use. If your child hasn’t seen them before, they may also have questions about prosthetic devices, like the running blades track and field athletes use.“Prosthetic devices really are aids that help people,” Lutges said. People use prosthetics when it helps them perform an activity, such as running. Your child may notice that some athletes with limb differences aren’t wearing prosthetics, and you can explain that it may not help them for whatever activity they are doing. Lutges suggested likening a prosthetic to a shoe: “People put on shoes to protect their feet. It’s the same kind of scenario for us to be able to wear shoes and be able to perform our daily tasks while making sure that we’re doing it in the safest manner for our bodies,” he said. Hearing aids or eyeglasses serve the same purpose. Praise athletes’ accomplishments without qualifying them. Thaker suggested that parents and caregivers make the effort to talk about Paralympic athletes the same way they would talk about anyone else. “Normalizing disability,” she said, “helps to prevent ‘othering’ anyone.”One way you can do this, she said, is to “praise an athlete based on their skill instead of based on the device they may use.” For example, you might say, “Look at how fast she is running!” instead of qualifying your praise by saying “Look at how fast she is running on that running blade” — just as you wouldn’t say, “Look how fast she is running for a girl.”Speak of Paralympic athletes just as you would Olympic athletes. They are all incredibly accomplished and competing on a world stage. “Avoid making comparisons based on prosthetic devices or other mobility aids, as these devices and aids do not attribute to a person’s character and existence,” Thaker said. Talk about each athlete as a whole person.It’s important that you treat disability as just one part of a person’s life story.“Disability is a part of their identity, while not their entire identity,” Thaker said.“Instead of focusing on why and how someone is disabled, learning about their story and their accomplishments can help to better understand disabilities.”Being able to talk about disabilities in a respectful way is an important skill, Thaker emphasized, as kids will encounter people with disabilities not only on the stage of the Paralympics but also out in their communities doing everyday things like buying groceries.The Paralympics is a great opportunity for kids to see what people with disabilities can do. The athletes are “succeeding as their best selves, competing against athletes of the same skill level, and for them to do this takes a lot of training and a lot of effort, just like everyone else,” Lutges said. Acknowledge the Paralympics’ relative lack of coverage.While you’re making an effort to explain how peoples’ differences don’t make their bodies any less cable, it’s important to note that our society doesn’t treat all bodies as having equal value. This is clearly indicated, as your child may notice, in the way that the Paralympics receive far less attention than the Olympics, despite the participants in both being world-class athletes.“While great strides have been made, there is still more that needs to be done for people who have disabilities to be equal,” Thaker said. Reassure kids who might worry about injury or illness.If you have a child who is prone to anxiety, they might worry that something will hpen to them that might result in them losing a limb. You can reassure kids that you are doing everything you can to keep them safe, and if they get hurt or sick, you will find people who can take care of them. Rather than getting bogged down in probabilities or the medical details of a particular injury, you might ask your child what they think would hpen if they got hurt that way. This could lead to meaningful conversations about what places in the community are accessible, or even the importance of not judging a person based on their pearance. Be comfortable saying, “I don’t know.”You won’t have the answer to every question your kid throws your way — whether about limb differences or some other topic. And that’s okay. Thaker recommended that you say something along the lines of, “I do not know, let’s learn together.” “By engaging in the conversation instead of dismissing it,” Thaker said, you can help guide your child’s questions toward a more inclusive way of thinking.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paralympics-talk-kids-limb-differences_l_66cf5864e4b0b422df212e6d,huffpost,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,4,-3,4.0,0.0,Disagree,Agree,"The article promotes inclusivity, understanding, and normalization of disabilities, which aligns more closely with Democratic values of diversity and social equity.
